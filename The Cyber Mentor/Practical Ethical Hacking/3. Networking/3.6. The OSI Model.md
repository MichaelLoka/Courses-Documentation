The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes and defines the functions of a network into a series of seven layers. Each layer in the OSI model has a specific role and interacts with the layers above and below it. The model helps in understanding and implementing network protocols and communication processes. Here are the seven layers of the OSI model:

### Model Layer Structure

1. **Physical Layer**: The Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting raw bitstream data over physical media, such as copper wires, fiber optics, or wireless signals. It deals with electrical, mechanical, and physical aspects of network communication.
2. **Data Link Layer**: The Data Link Layer provides error-free transmission of data frames between adjacent network nodes. It organizes bits into frames, adds necessary control information, and performs error detection and correction. Ethernet switches and MAC (Media Access Control) addresses operate at this layer.
3. **Network Layer**: The Network Layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing of data packets across multiple networks. It handles packet forwarding, addressing, and fragmentation, and ensures packets are delivered to the correct destination. IP (Internet Protocol) operates at this layer.
4. **Transport Layer**: The Transport Layer ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between end systems. It segments data received from the upper layers, adds sequencing information, and handles flow control and error recovery. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate at this layer.
5. **Session Layer**: The Session Layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications running on different devices. It handles session setup, synchronization, and teardown, as well as checkpointing and recovery in case of interruptions.
6. **Presentation Layer**: The Presentation Layer handles data representation, encryption, compression, and translation between different data formats. It ensures that data sent by the application layer of one device can be correctly interpreted by the application layer of another device.
7. **Application Layer**: The Application Layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly with applications and end-users. It provides services such as file transfer, email, web browsing, and other network applications. Protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DNS operate at this layer
