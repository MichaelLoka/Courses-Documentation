### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of data.
- It establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission.
- TCP ensures that packets are delivered in the correct order and without errors through mechanisms like acknowledgment, retransmission, and flow control.
- It guarantees data integrity and reliability but introduces some overhead due to the additional control mechanisms.
- TCP is widely used for applications that require reliable and sequential data delivery, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and streaming media.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides a lightweight and faster communication mechanism.
- It does not establish a connection before data transmission; packets are sent independently.
- UDP does not provide the same level of reliability as TCP, as it does not include built-in error checking, acknowledgment, or retransmission.
- However, UDP offers lower latency and overhead compared to TCP, making it suitable for real-time applications and situations where speed is more important than reliability.
- UDP is commonly used for applications like video streaming, VoIP (Voice over IP), DNS (Domain Name System), and online gaming, where real-time communication is critical.

### Three Way Handshake
The three-way handshake is a method used by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to establish a reliable connection between two devices. It is a three-step process that ensures both the sender and receiver are ready to exchange data and establishes parameters for reliable communication. Here are the steps involved in the three-way handshake:

![[3 Way Handshake.jpg]]

1. **Step 1: SYN (Synchronize)**:
    - The process begins with the client (initiating device) sending a TCP segment with the SYN (synchronize) flag set to the server (receiving device).
    - This segment contains an initial sequence number (ISN) randomly chosen by the client, which helps in tracking the sequence of transmitted data.
    - The SYN flag indicates that the client wants to establish a connection. <br>
2. **Step 2: SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment)**:
    - Upon receiving the SYN segment, the server responds with a TCP segment that has both the SYN and ACK (acknowledgment) flags set.
    - The server generates its own ISN and acknowledges the client's initial sequence number.
    - The SYN-ACK segment also includes the server's own initial sequence number for tracking data transmission. <br>
3. **Step 3: ACK (Acknowledgment)**:
    - In response to the server's SYN-ACK segment, the client sends an acknowledgment segment back to the server.
    - The ACK segment has the ACK flag set and acknowledges the server's initial sequence number.
    - At this point, the client and server have exchanged acknowledgment of each other's ISN, indicating a successful connection establishment.

Once the three-way handshake is completed, the TCP connection is established, and both devices are ready to exchange data reliably. The ACK segment sent by the client in the final step of the handshake can also carry additional data if needed.

The three-way handshake ensures that both the client and server are synchronized and ready to communicate, establishes initial sequence numbers, and confirms the reception of those numbers. This process helps establish a reliable and orderly data exchange between the communicating devices.


### Wireshark
Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer and packet capture tool. It is widely used by network administrators, security professionals, and developers to analyze network traffic, troubleshoot network issues, and inspect network protocols.

#### Key Features
1. **Packet Capture**: Wireshark can capture and analyze network packets in real-time. It supports capturing packets from various network interfaces and can capture packets from both wired and wireless networks.
2. **Protocol Analysis**: Wireshark allows for in-depth protocol analysis of captured packets. It can decode and dissect a wide range of network protocols, providing detailed information about each packet, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, packet timing, protocol headers, and payload data.
3. **Filtering and Search**: Wireshark provides powerful filtering capabilities to isolate and analyze specific packets or types of network traffic. It supports both display filters and capture filters to narrow down the packet set based on various criteria such as IP address, port number, protocol, packet length, and more. It also offers search functionality to find packets based on specific patterns or keywords.
4. **Statistics and Graphing**: Wireshark offers various statistics and analysis tools to visualize and interpret captured network data. It can generate summary statistics about packet counts, protocols used, throughput, and network latency. Wireshark also includes graphing capabilities to display packet rate, network utilization, and other performance metrics over time.
5. **Protocol Dissection and Reconstruction**: Wireshark can dissect network protocols at different layers and reconstruct higher-level protocols. It can extract and reassemble fragmented packets, detect protocol anomalies, and provide detailed analysis of protocol behavior and interactions.
6. **Customization and Extensibility**: Wireshark provides a customizable and extensible framework. Users can create custom dissectors and protocol analyzers to handle proprietary or non-standard protocols. Additionally, Wireshark supports scripting and plugins, allowing users to extend its functionality or automate specific tasks.
