Subnetting is the practice of dividing a single, larger network into smaller subnetworks, known as subnets. It involves partitioning the available IP address space of a network into more manageable and efficient segments. Subnetting offers several benefits, including efficient IP address allocation, improved network performance, and enhanced network security.

### Key Aspects

1. **IP Addressing**: Subnetting allows for more efficient utilization of IP addresses. It involves dividing the available IP address range into smaller, logical segments called subnets. Each subnet is assigned a range of IP addresses, enabling more precise allocation of addresses based on the network's requirements.
2. **Network Segmentation**: Subnetting enables the division of a larger network into smaller, interconnected subnetworks. This segmentation provides several advantages, such as improved network performance, reduced broadcast traffic, and enhanced network management.
3. **Subnet Mask**: A subnet mask is a 32-bit value used to identify the network portion and host portion of an IP address. It defines the boundary between the network and host parts. By manipulating the subnet mask, subnetting determines the size of the subnets and the number of hosts per subnet.
4. **Subnet Identification**: Each subnet is identified by a unique network ID, derived from the IP address and the subnet mask. The network ID helps routers and devices determine if a destination IP address is within the same subnet or requires routing to another subnet.
5. **Routing**: Subnets facilitate efficient routing within a network. Routers examine the network ID portion of an IP address to determine the appropriate path for delivering packets. Subnetting allows for more specific routing decisions and reduces the amount of network traffic sent to other subnets.
6. **Subnetting Notation**: Subnetting is often expressed using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. CIDR notation combines the IP address with a slash and a number, indicating the number of bits used for the network portion. For example, 192.168.0.0/24 represents a subnet with a 24-bit network mask.

### Mathematical Calculations

1. **Determining the Number of Subnets**: 
    - To calculate the number of subnets, you need to determine the number of subnet bits in the subnet mask. Let's denote the number of subnet bits as "n".
    - The formula to calculate the number of subnets is 2^n, where "^" denotes exponentiation.
    - For example, if you have 3 subnet bits (n = 3), the number of subnets is 2^3 = 8.
2. **Determining the Number of Hosts per Subnet**: 
    - To calculate the number of hosts per subnet, you need to determine the number of host bits in the subnet mask. Let's denote the number of host bits as "m".
    - The formula to calculate the number of hosts per subnet is 2^m - 2, where "^" denotes exponentiation. The "- 2" is to account for the network address and broadcast address, which cannot be assigned to hosts. 
    - For example, if you have 4 host bits (m = 4), the number of hosts per subnet is 2^4 - 2 = 14.
3. **Calculating Subnet Mask Length**: 
    - The subnet mask length indicates the number of consecutive bits set to 1 in the subnet mask. To calculate the subnet mask length, you can use the formula 32 - n, where "n" is the number of subnet bits. 
    - For example, if you have 3 subnet bits, the subnet mask length is 32 - 3 = 29.
4. **Determining Subnet Range**: 
    - To determine the range of IP addresses for each subnet, you need to consider the network address and the subnet mask length. Let's assume an IP address of 192.168.0.0/29 
    - For example:
	    1. The network address is 192.168.0.0.
	    2. The first usable IP address within the subnet is the network address + 1, which is 192.168.0.1.
	    3. The last usable IP address within the subnet is the broadcast address - 1, which is 192.168.0.6.
	    4. The broadcast address is the network address with all host bits set to 1, which is 192.168.0.7.
