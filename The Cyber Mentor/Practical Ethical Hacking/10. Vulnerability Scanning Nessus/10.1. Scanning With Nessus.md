Nessus is a widely-used commercial vulnerability scanning tool developed by Tenable. It is designed to identify security vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications. Nessus helps organizations proactively assess their security posture by scanning for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.

1. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Nessus performs automated vulnerability scanning to identify potential security issues in networks, servers, endpoints, and applications. It can detect a wide range of vulnerabilities, including software flaws, missing patches, weak passwords, and misconfigurations.
2. **Plugin Architecture:** Nessus utilizes a plugin-based architecture, where each plugin checks for specific vulnerabilities or potential weaknesses. The Nessus plugin feed is continuously updated with new checks to stay current with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
3. **Compliance Checks:** Nessus includes built-in compliance checks based on industry standards (e.g., CIS, DISA STIG, PCI DSS). These checks help organizations ensure their systems adhere to specific security standards and regulatory requirements.
4. **Policy Customization:** Users can customize scanning policies based on their specific needs and requirements. This flexibility allows for fine-tuning scans to focus on critical assets or specific vulnerability types.
5. **Scan Scheduling and Reporting:** Nessus provides scheduling capabilities for automating regular scans at predefined intervals. The tool also generates comprehensive reports with detailed findings, prioritized vulnerabilities, and remediation recommendations.
6. **Agent-Based Scanning:** In addition to traditional network scanning, Nessus offers agent-based scanning. Agents can be installed on endpoints, enabling organizations to assess systems that are not always connected to the network or are located in remote environments.
7. **Integration with Other Tools:** Nessus can integrate with other security tools and platforms, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, to enhance security visibility and response capabilities.

#### How to Use It
- **Install On Linux:**
```bash
$ dpkg -i Nessus-10.5.3-ubuntu1404_amd64.deb
$ /etc/init.d/nessusd start
$ /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
```
1. **Start the Nessus Service:** Once Nessus is installed, start the Nessus service on your system. The method to start the service may vary depending on your operating system and how you installed Nessus. On Linux systems, you can use commands like `systemctl` or `service` to start the service. On Windows, you can start it from the Services Manager.
2. **Open the Web Interface:** After starting the service, open a web browser and navigate to the Nessus web interface. The default URL for Nessus is usually: `https://localhost:8834/`
3. **Login:** On the login page, enter your Nessus credentials. If this is your first time accessing Nessus, you may be prompted to create an administrator account and set the password.
4. **License Activation:** If Nessus requires activation or license verification, you will be prompted to enter your license key or perform the necessary activation steps.
5. **Create a New Scan:** Once logged in, you will be taken to the Nessus Dashboard. To perform a vulnerability scan, click on "Scans" in the left-hand navigation menu and then click "New Scan" to create a new scan.
6. **Configure Scan Settings:** In the new scan configuration page, you can customize the scan settings. Provide a name for the scan, specify the target(s) you want to scan (IP addresses or ranges), and choose the scan policy. Nessus comes with predefined scan policies like "Basic Network Scan," "Web Application Tests," and others. You can also create custom scan policies tailored to your needs.
7. **Start the Scan:** Once you have configured the scan settings, click "Save" to save the scan configuration. After saving, click "Launch" to start the scan.
8. **View Scan Results:** Nessus will begin scanning the target systems for vulnerabilities based on the selected scan policy. Depending on the size and complexity of the target, the scan may take some time to complete. You can monitor the scan progress from the "Scans" section.
9. **Analyze and Export Results:** After the scan completes, you can view the scan results by clicking on the completed scan from the "Scans" section. Nessus will present a detailed report of the vulnerabilities found, including severity levels, descriptions, and remediation recommendations. You can also export the scan report in various formats, such as PDF or CSV.
10. **Remediation and Follow-Up:** Review the scan results to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Work with your IT team to remediate the discovered issues and take appropriate security measures to improve your system's overall security.

#### Nessus Tabs
