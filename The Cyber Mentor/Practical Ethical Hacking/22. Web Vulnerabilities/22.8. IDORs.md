### Overview
IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes direct references to internal implementation objects (e.g., files, database records, or resources) in a predictable or insecure manner. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the object references and access unauthorized data or perform unauthorized actions.

IDOR vulnerabilities typically arise when an application relies solely on client-supplied input (such as parameters in URLs or form fields) to identify and access objects without proper authorization checks. Attackers can exploit IDOR to access sensitive data, escalate privileges, or modify records belonging to other users.

**Note:** BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) is considered the same as IDOR

#### Examples
1. **IDOR Exploit in User Account Access:** Suppose a web application uses the user ID as a parameter to fetch user account details: `https://example.com/profile?id=123`
	- If the application does not properly enforce access control, an attacker could try changing the ID parameter to access other users' profiles: `https://example.com/profile?id=456`  
	- By manipulating the ID parameter, the attacker gains unauthorized access to other users' profiles.
2. **IDOR Exploit in File Access:** An online file storage application may allow users to access their files using direct object references: `https://example.com/files?id=ABC123`
	- If the application does not verify whether the file with the given ID belongs to the authenticated user, an attacker can try different IDs to access other users' files: `https://example.com/files?id=XYZ789`
	- The attacker could potentially view or download files that belong to other users. 
3. **IDOR Exploit in Record Modification:** In a web application with a "change password" feature, the application might use the user ID to identify the user whose password needs to be changed: `https://example.com/change-password?id=123`
	- If the application lacks proper authorization checks, an attacker could modify the ID parameter to change the password of another user: `https://example.com/change-password?id=456`
	- The attacker can now change the password of the user with ID 456, regardless of their own account.
4. **IDOR Exploit in Order Manipulation:** An e-commerce website may use order IDs in URLs to access order details: `https://example.com/orders?id=789`
	- If the application doesn't verify ownership of the order, an attacker can modify the ID parameter to view other users' order details: `https://example.com/orders?id=123`
	- The attacker can now view the order details of the user with ID 123, even if they don't have access to that order.

#### Mitigation
1. **Use Indirect References:** Avoid exposing direct object references to internal resources and instead use indirect references, such as unique tokens or hashes, that are not easily predictable or guessable.
2. **Enforce Authorization Checks:** Always check if the user making the request has the appropriate permissions to access or modify the requested object.
3. **Validate User Input:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input to ensure it is valid, within expected ranges, and does not contain malicious data.
4. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to assign specific permissions to users based on their roles or privileges.
5. **Limit Exposure of IDs:** Minimize the exposure of internal object IDs to users, and use server-side sessions or cookies to handle user-specific data.
6. **Test Security Controls:** Regularly conduct security testing, including code reviews, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments, to identify and fix potential IDOR vulnerabilities.

### Attack Vector
1. **If you have IDs of users on a website that is accessed through URL parameter**
2. **Then you can make a list of feasible IDs and brute force your way through**
```bash
fuff -u 'http://localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=FUZZ' -w num.txt
```
3. **Then you can filter with size to remove the not found pages**
