Docker is a popular open-source platform used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies, making it easy to run consistently across different environments.

1. **System Requirements:**
	- 64-bit architecture
	- Kernel version 3.10 or higher
	- Support for `cgroup` and `aufs` storage driver (most modern Linux distributions have these enabled by default)
2. **Installation:**
	- The installation process can vary depending on the Linux distribution you are using. Docker provides official installation guides for popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, and more. Follow the appropriate guide for your distribution here: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
	```bash
	sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
	sudo systemctl start docker
	sudo systemctl enable docker 
	```
3. **Verifying Docker Installation:**
	```bash
	docker --version
	```
	It should display the installed Docker version.
4. **Running Docker Commands:**
	- `docker run`: Run a container from an image.
	- `docker ps`: List running containers.
	- `docker ps -a`: List all containers (both running and stopped).
	- `docker images`: List downloaded images.
	- `docker pull`: Download an image from a container registry.
	- `docker build`: Build a new Docker image from a Dockerfile.
	- `docker-compose stop`: Stop a running container.
	- `docker-compose rm`: Remove a running container.
	```bash
	sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
	sudo docker-compose rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)
	```
	- This command starts an Nginx web server container, and it will be accessible on port 80 of your host machine.
5. **Docker Documentation:** 
	- Docker has comprehensive documentation available on its official website. You can refer to the Docker documentation to explore more Docker features and use cases: [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)
	- Remember that Docker commands often require root or sudo privileges. To run Docker commands without sudo, you can add your user to the docker group:
	```bash
	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	```
	- After adding your user to the `docker` group, you will need to log out and log back in to apply changes.

### [TCM Labs Setup](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/CbIyLkOuS4GUH7TNFTFg)
- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt upgrade`
- `sudo apt install docker.io`
- `sudo apt install docker-compose`

**RESTART YOUR VM**

Copy the labs to a directory in your system, then open a terminal to that directory
- `tar -xf peh-web-labs.tar.gz`
- `cd labs`
- `sudo docker-compose up`

(Keep reading! There is one more thing to do after the lab is built!)

The first time it runs, it will need to download some things, it may take a while depending on your connection. Next time you run it though, it will be much faster.

Once you see the databases are 'ready for connections' the containers should be ready to go.

The final step is to set some permissions for the webserver, this is needed for the file upload labs and the capstone challenge.
`./set-permissions.sh`

Browse to `http://localhost`

The first time you load the lab the database will need to be initialized, just follow the instructions in the red box by clicking the link, then coming back to the homepage.

Enjoy your labs!
