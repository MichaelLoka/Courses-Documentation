```shell
$ sudo apt update && apt upgrade
```
1. sudo apt update:
	- The "sudo apt update" command is used to update the local package lists from the repositories.
	- It retrieves the latest information about available packages, including their versions and dependencies.
	- This command does not upgrade the installed packages, but only updates the package lists.
2. sudo apt upgrade:  
	- The "sudo apt upgrade" command is used to upgrade the installed packages on the system.
	- It retrieves the latest versions of the packages from the repositories and installs them if updates are available.
	- This command upgrades the packages to their latest versions while respecting package dependencies.


### APT
The "apt" command is a powerful package management tool used in Debian-based Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. It provides a user-friendly and efficient way to handle packages, including installing, upgrading, removing, and managing software. Here's a detailed illustration of the "apt" command:

1. Basic Usage:
	- To perform package management tasks using the "apt" command:
		-  `$ apt <command> [options]` 
		- Replace `<command>` with the specific action you want to perform, and `[options]` with any additional parameters or flags.
2. Common Commands:
	- `update`: Updates the local package lists from the repositories, downloading the latest information about available packages.
	- `upgrade`: Upgrades installed packages to their latest versions while respecting package dependencies.
	- `install`: Installs one or more packages, resolving and installing any necessary dependencies.
	- `remove`: Uninstalls one or more packages from the system, but leaves their configuration files intact.
	- `purge`: Uninstalls one or more packages along with their configuration files.
	- `search`: Searches for packages by name or keywords in the package descriptions.
	- `show`: Displays detailed information about a specific package, including its version, dependencies, and description.
	- `autoremove`: Removes packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed by any other installed package.
3. Examples:
	- To update the package lists:
		- `$ apt update`
	- To upgrade the installed packages:
		- `$ apt upgrade`
	- To install a package:    
		- `$ apt install package_name`
	- To remove a package:
		- `$ apt remove package_name`
	- To search for a package:    
		- `$ apt search keyword`
	- To display detailed information about a package:
		- `$ apt show package_name`
4. Additional Options and Flags:
	- The "apt" command provides numerous additional options and flags to customize its behavior.
	- Some commonly used options include `-y` (to automatically answer "yes" to prompts), `--no-install-recommends` (to skip recommended packages during installation), and `--purge` (to remove configuration files during package removal).
5. Difference between "apt" & "apt-get":
	1. User Interface:
	    - "apt" (Advanced Package Tool) aims to provide a more user-friendly and intuitive command-line interface for package management.
	    - "apt-get" (APT package handling utility) is the traditional command-line tool for package management, with a more basic and straightforward interface.
	2. Command Syntax:
	    - The commands and options in "apt" and "apt-get" are similar, but there are slight differences in their syntax.
	    - "apt" uses a simplified command structure and omits some of the lesser-used options found in "apt-get".
	    - "apt" provides more intuitive and user-friendly commands, such as "apt install" instead of "apt-get install".
	3. Progress Bar and Output Formatting:
	    - "apt" includes a built-in progress bar during package installation or upgrade, providing visual feedback on the download and installation progress.
	    - "apt" also offers improved output formatting, making the information more readable and easier to understand.
	4. Caching Behavior:
	    - "apt" maintains a package cache on the local system, storing downloaded package files in `/var/cache/apt/archives/`.
	    - "apt-get" does not have the built-in package caching behavior like "apt". Instead, it relies on the separate "apt-get update" and "apt-get upgrade" commands to update the package lists and upgrade the system.
	5. Additional Features:
	    - "apt" provides additional features not found in "apt-get". For example, it includes the "apt list" command to display a list of packages, "apt show" to show detailed package information, and "apt autoremove" to automatically remove no longer needed packages.

### Git
Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It offers a powerful set of commands for managing repositories, branches, commits, and more. Here's an illustration of some common Git commands:

1. Initializing a Repository:
	- To initialize a new Git repository in a directory:
		- `$ git init`
	- This command creates a new, empty Git repository in the current directory.
2. Cloning a Repository: 
	- To clone an existing repository from a remote server:       
		- `$ git clone <repository_url>`
	- Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the remote repository. This command creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.
3. Adding and Committing Changes:  
	- To stage changes for commit:
		- `$ git add <file_name>`
		- Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the file you want to stage. You can use `.` to stage all changes in the current directory.
	- To commit the staged changes:
		- `$ git commit -m "Commit message"`
		- Replace `"Commit message"` with a brief and descriptive message summarizing the changes you are committing.
4. Branching and Merging: 
	- To create a new branch:
		- `$ git branch <branch_name>`
		- Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the new branch.
	- To switch to a different branch:
		- `$ git checkout <branch_name>`
		- Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to.
	- To merge changes from one branch into another:
		- `$ git merge <branch_name>`
		- Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to merge into the current branch.
5. Checking Repository Status:
	- To check the status of the repository, including changes and branch information:
		- `$ git status`
		- This command provides an overview of the current state of the repository.
6. Pulling and Pushing: 
	- To fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the current branch:
		- `$ git pull`
		- This command retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository and updates your local branch.
	- To push local commits to a remote repository:
		- `$ git push`
		- This command uploads your local commits to the remote repository.
7. Viewing Commit History: 
	- To view the commit history:
		- `$ git log`
		- This command displays a list of commits, including the commit ID, author, date, and commit message.
