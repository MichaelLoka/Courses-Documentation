### 1. LS
The "ls" command is used to list files and directories in a directory. It provides various options to customize the output. Here's a breakdown of the most commonly used options and their effects:

1. Basic usage: `ls [options] [directory]`
	- Without any options, it lists the files and directories in the current directory.
	- You can specify a directory as an argument to list the contents of that directory instead of the current directory.
2. Options:
	- `-l`: Long format listing   
		- Displays detailed information about each file and directory.
		- The output includes file permissions, ownership, size, modification time, and other details.
		```shell
		$ ls -l 
		-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   4096 Jul  1 12:34 file.txt 
		drwxr-xr-x  2 user  group   4096 Jul  1 12:35 directory
		```

	-  `-a`: All files (including hidden files)
		- Lists all files and directories, including those whose names start with a dot (hidden files).
		- By default, ls hides files and directories with names beginning with a dot.
		```sh
		$ ls -a 
		.  ..  file.txt  .hidden_directory
		```

	- `-h`: Human-readable file sizes
		- Displays file sizes in a human-readable format, such as "K" for kilobytes and "M" for megabytes.
		- Makes it easier to understand the file sizes at a glance.
		```shell
		$ ls -lh 
		-rw-r--r--  1 user  group  4.0K Jul  1 12:34 file.txt 
		drwxr-xr-x  2 user  group  4.0K Jul  1 12:35 directory
		```

	- `-R`: Recursive listing
		- Lists the files and directories recursively, including subdirectories.
		- It traverses through all the subdirectories, displaying their contents as well.
		```shell
		$ ls -R
		.:
		file.txt  directory
		
		./directory:
		file2.txt  subdir
		```

	- `-t`: Sort by modification time
		- Sorts the files and directories based on their modification time, with the most recently modified appearing first.
		- Useful for quickly identifying the latest files or recently modified files.
		```shell
		$ ls -lt 
		-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   4096 Jul  5 09:15 file2.txt 
		drwxr-xr-x  2 user  group   4096 Jul  5 09:12 directory 
		-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   4096 Jul  1 12:34 file.txt
		```


These are just a few examples of options you can use with the "ls" command. You can combine multiple options together (e.g., `ls -lha`) to get the desired output. Additionally, the "ls" command provides more options for customization, such as sorting by file size, permissions, or extension. You can explore the full range of options in the command's documentation (`man ls`).

### 2. CD
The "cd" command is used to change the current working directory in a Linux system. Here's a detailed explanation of the "cd" command:

1. Basic usage: `cd [directory]`
    - Without any arguments, the "cd" command takes you to your home directory.
    - You can specify a directory as an argument to change the current directory to that specified directory.
2. Examples:
	- To change to the home directory:
		- `$ cd`
	- To change to a specific directory:
		- `$ cd /path/to/directory`
	- To change to the parent directory:
		- `$ cd ..`
	- To change to the previous directory:
		- `$ cd -`
3. Additional usage and tips:
	- Relative paths: You can use relative paths as an argument to the "cd" command. For example, if you are in the "/home/user" directory and want to change to the "/home/user/documents" directory, you can use: 
		- `$ cd documents`
	- Tab completion: When typing the directory name, you can press the Tab key to have the terminal auto-complete the directory name, making it easier and faster to navigate through the file system.
	- Environment variables: You can use environment variables in place of directory names with the "cd" command. For example, to change to the user's home directory, you can use:
		- `$ cd $HOME`
	- Absolute vs. relative paths: The "cd" command accepts both absolute and relative paths. Absolute paths start with a forward slash ("/") and specify the full path from the root directory, while relative paths specify the path relative to the current directory.
	- Directory names with spaces: If a directory name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotes (single or double quotes) to avoid any issues. For example:
		- `$ cd "directory name with spaces"`
	- Symlinks: If you encounter symbolic links while navigating directories, the "cd" command automatically follows them, taking you to the target directory.

Remember that the "cd" command only changes the current working directory for the current terminal session. It doesn't affect other open terminals or the system as a whole.

### 3. PWD
The "pwd" command stands for "print working directory" and is used to display the current working directory, which is the directory you are currently in within the file system. Here's a detailed explanation of the "pwd" command:

1. Basic usage: `pwd`
    - Simply running the "pwd" command without any options or arguments displays the current working directory.
2. Example:
	- The user is now on the documents directory 
	```shell
	$ pwd 
	/home/user/documents
	  ```  
3. Additional information:
	- Full path: The "pwd" command always displays the full path of the current working directory, starting from the root directory ("/") and listing all the directories leading to the current location.
	- Use in scripts: The "pwd" command is often used in scripts to capture and use the current directory's path for further operations.
	- Verifying current directory: Running "pwd" can help you confirm the directory you are in, especially if you have changed directories using "cd" or other commands.
	- Subshell behavior: If you run a subshell using parentheses or a subshell command, the "pwd" command will show the current directory within that subshell, which may be different from the main shell's current directory.
