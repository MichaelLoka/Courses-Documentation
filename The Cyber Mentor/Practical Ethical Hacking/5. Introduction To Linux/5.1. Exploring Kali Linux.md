    - `Ctrl + D`: Sends an end-of-file (EOF) signal, usually used to exit a shell.
    - `Ctrl + R`: Initiates a reverse search through command history.
    - `Ctrl + Z`: Suspends the current process and puts it in the background.
2. **Command History:**
    - `Up Arrow` or `Ctrl + P`: Scrolls through previous commands.
    - `Down Arrow` or `Ctrl + N`: Scrolls through subsequent commands.
    - `Ctrl + R`: Initiates a reverse search through command history.
    - `!!`: Repeats the last command.
    - `!n`: Repeats the command with the number `n` from the command history.
3. **Output Redirection:**
    - `command > file`: Redirects the standard output of a command to a file.
    - `command >> file`: Appends the standard output of a command to a file.
    - `command 2> file`: Redirects the standard error output of a command to a file.
    - `command &> file`: Redirects both the standard output and standard error output of a command to a file.
4. **Process Management:**
    - `Ctrl + Z`: Suspends the current process and puts it in the background.
    - `jobs`: Lists the current background jobs.
    - `fg`: Brings the most recent background job to the foreground.
    - `bg`: Resumes a suspended job in the background.
5. **Terminal Multiplexers:**
    - `tmux`: Launches the terminal multiplexer tool, which allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.
    - `Ctrl + B, C`: Creates a new window within tmux.
    - `Ctrl + B, N`: Switches to the next window.
    - `Ctrl + B, P`: Switches to the previous window.
    - `Ctrl + B, D`: Detaches from the tmux session, leaving it running in the background.
