In Linux, users and privileges play a crucial role in managing system access and security. Here's an explanation of Linux users and their privileges:

### Overview
1. **Users:**
	- Linux is a multi-user operating system, which means it can have multiple user accounts, each with its own settings, files, and privileges.
	- User accounts are created to allow individuals to log into the system and perform various tasks.
	- Every user account has a unique username and is associated with a user ID (UID) that identifies the account.
	- User accounts can be classified into two main types: regular users and system users.
	- Regular users are created for human users and are typically used for day-to-day tasks.
	- System users are created for specific services or processes running on the system and do not have login capabilities. <br>
2. **User Privileges:**
	- User privileges define the level of access and control that a user has over the system.
	- In Linux, there are three main categories of user privileges:
		- Regular user: A regular user has limited privileges and can only access and modify files and directories they have permission for.
		- Administrator (root): The root user, also known as the superuser or administrator, has full control over the system. The root user can perform administrative tasks, modify system files, install software, and change system configurations.
		- Special privileges: Linux provides additional privileges that can be granted to users temporarily or permanently using mechanisms like sudo (Superuser Do) or by assigning specific permissions to certain files or directories. <br>
3. **User Management:**
	- User management in Linux involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts.
	- The "useradd" command is used to create a new user account, while the "usermod" command is used to modify an existing user account.
	- The "passwd" command is used to set or change a user's password.
	- System administrators are responsible for managing user accounts and ensuring appropriate access levels and permissions are assigned. <br>
4. **File and Directory Permissions:**
    - Linux implements a robust file and directory permission system that determines which users can access, modify, or execute specific files and directories.
    - Each file and directory is associated with permissions for three different types of users: the owner, the group, and others.
    - Permissions are represented by read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions, and can be granted or revoked for each user type.
    - The "chmod" command is used to change file and directory permissions. <br>

### Permissions
There are 10 placeholders for a file permission
- The $1st$ is d permission
- The $2nd→4th$ is owner permissions
- The $5th→7th$ is group permissions
- The $8th→10th$ is other permissions

For each 3 Bits of permissions
- The $1st$ is "r"
- The $2nd$ is "w"
- The $3rd$ is "x"

If present then the file has the permission, else the permission placeholder we be donated as "-",
this means that it doesn't has the permission

1. **"d": Directory Permission**
	- The letter "d" represents the permission to access and list the contents of a directory.
	- When "d" is present, it indicates that the entry is a directory.
	- `drwxr-xr-x`
2. **"w": Write Permission**
	- The letter "w" represents the permission to modify (write to) a file or directory.
	- When "w" is present, it allows the user or group to make changes to the file or directory.
	- `-rw-r--r--`
3. **"r": Read Permission**
	- The letter "r" represents the permission to view or read the contents of a file or directory.
	- When "r" is present, it allows the user or group to access and read the file or directory.
	- `-rw-r--r--`
4. **"x": Execute Permission**
	- The letter "x" represents the permission to execute a file or access a directory as a working directory.
	- When "x" is present for a file, it allows the user or group to run the file as a program or script.
	- When "x" is present for a directory, it grants permission to access the contents of the directory and navigate through it.
	- `drwxr-xr-x`

### Numeric Representation
In Linux, file permissions are represented using a 3-digit octal number, where each digit corresponds to the permission set for a specific user type: owner, group, and others.

The digits represent the sum of the permission values for read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions:
- Read (r): 4
- Write (w): 2
- Execute (x): 1

This is the permissions numeric representation for each group

So 644 means:
6 For the Owner → rw-
4 For the Group → r--
4 For the Other → r--
