The "sudo" command in Linux stands for "superuser do" and allows authorized users to execute commands with the privileges of the superuser or another user. By default, the superuser in Linux is the "root" user, who has unrestricted access to all system resources and can perform administrative tasks.

The sudo command provides a way to delegate temporary administrative privileges to regular users, allowing them to perform specific actions that would normally require root access. When a user runs a command with sudo, they are prompted to enter their own password (not the root password) to verify their identity. If the user is authorized and their password is correct, the command is executed with elevated privileges.

Using sudo helps maintain security by reducing the need for users to log in as the root user permanently, which can be risky. It allows administrators to grant fine-grained control over which users or groups can perform privileged actions while keeping a log of their activities.

### Some Useful Properties
1. Running a command as another user: Besides executing commands as the root user, sudo allows running commands as any other user on the system. This can be done using the "-u" option followed by the username.
	- `sudo -u username command`
2. Running a command as a specific group: The "-g" option allows running a command as a specific group instead of the user's default group.
	- `sudo -g groupname command`
3. Running a command in the background: The "-b" option allows running a command in the background, without requiring it to be attached to the current terminal session. This can be useful for running system maintenance tasks.
	- `sudo -b command` 
4. Preserving the environment variables: By default, sudo sanitizes the environment variables to provide a secure execution environment. However, sometimes it may be necessary to preserve certain variables. The "-E" option can be used to preserve the user environment. 
	- `sudo -E command`  
5. Editing the sudoers file: The "visudo" command allows safely editing the sudoers file, which determines who can use sudo and what commands they are authorized to run. The "visudo" command checks the syntax of the file and prevents simultaneous edits by multiple users, avoiding potential conflicts.
	- `sudo visudo`
6. Timeouts and authentication caching: Sudo has options to control the timeout duration and authentication caching behavior. The "timestamp_timeout" setting in the sudoers file determines how long a sudo session remains valid before re-authentication is required. 
	- `sudo -k`

### Logging as Root

```
sudo su -
```

- You will be prompted to enter the root user's password. Type the password and press Enter. Note that when entering the password, no characters or symbols will be displayed on the screen.
- If the password is correct, the terminal prompt will change to indicate that you are now logged in as the root user. It typically changes from "$" to "#" or displays the username as "root@hostname".
- To exit the root user session and return to your regular user account, you can use the "exit" command or simply close the terminal window.
