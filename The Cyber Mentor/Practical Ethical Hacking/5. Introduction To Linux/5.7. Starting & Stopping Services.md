### Service Command
The "service" command in Linux is used to control system services, which are background processes or daemons that provide specific functionality or manage system components. Here's a detailed illustration of the "service" command:

1. Basic Usage:
	- To manage a service using the "service" command:
		- `$ service <service_name> <action>`
		- Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service you want to manage, and `<action>` with the desired action (e.g., start, stop, restart, status).
2. Examples: 
	- To start a service:
		- `$ service apache2 start`
	- To stop a service:
		- `$ service apache2 stop`
	- To restart a service:
		- `$ service apache2 restart`
	- To check the status of a service:
		- `$ service apache2 status`
3. Common Actions:
	- `start`: Starts the specified service.
	- `stop`: Stops the specified service.
	- `restart`: Stops and then starts the specified service.
	- `status`: Displays the current status of the specified service.
	- `reload`: Reloads the configuration of the specified service without stopping it.
4. Service Names:
	- Service names may vary depending on the Linux distribution and the services installed on your system.
	- Common services that can be managed with the "service" command include Apache HTTP Server (apache2), MySQL (mysql), SSH (ssh), and many others.
5. Service Control Scripts:
	- The "service" command interacts with service control scripts located in the `/etc/init.d/` directory or its equivalents.
	- These scripts provide the logic to manage the corresponding services, including starting, stopping, and checking the status of the services.
6. Service Management Alternatives:
	- The "service" command is commonly used on System V init-based systems.
	- On systemd-based systems, the "systemctl" command is typically used for managing services.
	- The "service" command is often available as a backward-compatible tool on systemd-based systems as well.

### Systemctl
The "systemctl" command is used to control and manage systemd units in Linux. Systemd is a system and service manager that provides advanced features for controlling the startup, stopping, and monitoring of services. Here's a detailed illustration of the "systemctl" command:

1. Basic Usage:
	- To manage a service or unit using the "systemctl" command:
		- `$ systemctl <action> <unit_name>`
		- Replace `<action>` with the desired action (e.g., start, stop, restart, enable, disable, status) and `<unit_name>` with the name of the unit you want to manage.
2. Examples: 
	- To start a service:
		- `$ systemctl start apache2`
	- To stop a service:
		- `$ systemctl stop apache2`
	- To restart a service:
		- `$ systemctl restart apache2`
	- To enable a service to start on boot:
		- `$ systemctl enable apache2`
	- To disable a service from starting on boot:
		- `$ systemctl disable apache2`
	- To check the status of a service:
		- `$ systemctl status apache2`
3. Common Actions:
	- `start`: Starts the specified unit.
	- `stop`: Stops the specified unit.
	- `restart`: Stops and then starts the specified unit.
	- `enable`: Configures the specified unit to start on boot.
	- `disable`: Configures the specified unit to not start on boot.
	- `status`: Displays the current status of the specified unit.
4. Unit Types:
	- Systemd manages various types of units, including services, sockets, timers, devices, mounts, and more.
	- Common unit names include services (e.g., apache2, mysql), timers (e.g., cron), and sockets (e.g., ssh).
5. Systemd Control Hierarchy:
	- Systemd units are organized in a control hierarchy, with system-level units located in `/etc/systemd/system/` and user-level units located in `~/.config/systemd/user/`.
	- Systemd provides additional commands for managing other aspects of the system, such as "systemctl daemon-reload" to reload systemd configuration files after modifications.
6. Journal Logs: 
	- Systemd maintains detailed logs for services and units in a central journal, which can be accessed using the "journalctl" command.

### PS
The "ps" command in Linux is used to provide information about currently running processes on a system. It displays a snapshot of active processes at the time the command is executed. Here's a detailed illustration of the "ps" command:

1. Basic Usage:
	- To display information about active processes:
		- `$ ps [options]`
2. Examples: 
	- To display a list of running processes:
		- `$ ps`
	- To display detailed information for all processes running under the current user:
		- `$ ps -f`
	- To display all processes running on the system, including those of other users:
		- `$ ps -e`
	- To display a continuously updating list of active processes:
		- `$ ps aux`
3. Options:
	- `-f`: Displays full-format listing, including additional details like process ID (PID), parent process ID (PPID), CPU usage, start time, and more.
	- `-e`: Displays information about all processes, regardless of the user.
	- `aux`: Combines the options `a`, `u`, and `x` to display a comprehensive list of all processes running on the system, including detailed information and processes not associated with a terminal.
4. Output Columns: 
	- `PID`: Process ID, a unique identifier for each process.
	- `PPID`: Parent process ID, the ID of the process that spawned the current process.
	- `USER`: User who owns the process.
	- `%CPU`: CPU usage percentage.
	- `%MEM`: Memory usage percentage.
	- `VSZ`: Virtual memory size in kilobytes.
	- `RSS`: Resident Set Size, the amount of physical memory used by the process.
	- `START`: Start time or date of the process.
	- `COMMAND`: Command or program name associated with the process.
5. Filtering and Sorting:
	- The "ps" command can be combined with other commands, such as "grep" or "sort", to filter or sort the displayed process list based on specific criteria.
	- For example, to find a specific process by its name:
		- `$ ps aux | grep process_name`
	- To sort processes by CPU usage:
		- `$ ps aux --sort=-%CPU`
