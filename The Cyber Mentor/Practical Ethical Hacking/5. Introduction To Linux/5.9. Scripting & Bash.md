### Grep
The `grep` command in Linux is a powerful tool used for searching and filtering text based on specified patterns. It allows you to search files or command output for lines that match a given pattern. Here's a detailed illustration of the `grep` command:

1. Basic Usage:
	- To search for a specific pattern in a file:
		- `$ grep pattern filename`
		- Replace `pattern` with the text you want to search for and `filename` with the name of the file you want to search in.
		- If the pattern is found, `grep` displays the matching lines.
2. Regular Expression Support: 
	- `grep` supports the use of regular expressions to define complex search patterns.
	- Regular expressions allow for more advanced pattern matching, including wildcard characters, character classes, quantifiers, and more.
3. Command Output as Input:
	- `grep` can also search the output of another command by using the pipe (`|`) symbol to redirect the output as input to `grep`.
	- For example, to search for a pattern in the output of a command:
		- `$ command | grep pattern`
4. Common Options:
	- `-i`: Performs a case-insensitive search, ignoring uppercase and lowercase distinctions.
	- `-v`: Inverts the search, displaying lines that do not match the pattern.
	- `-r` or `-R`: Recursively searches directories and their contents for the specified pattern.
	- `-l`: Lists only the names of files that contain the pattern, rather than displaying the matching lines.
	- `-n`: Displays the line numbers along with the matching lines.
5. Multiple Patterns: 
	- `grep` can search for multiple patterns by using the OR operator (`|`) between patterns.
	- For example, to search for lines containing either "pattern1" or "pattern2":
		- `$ grep "pattern1\|pattern2" filename`
- Advanced Usage:
	- `grep` can be combined with other command-line tools and options to perform complex searches and manipulations of text data.
	- For example to search for lines containing "64 byte" and cut at the space as a delimiter then take the $4th$ items from that line then trim the ":" if present.
		- `$ cat file.txt | grep -i "64 Bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":"`

### Some Bash Scripts
###### IP Sweep
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
	ping -c 1 192.168.4.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d "" -f 4 | tr -d ":"
done
```
**Explanation:**
	1. `#!/bin/bash`: This line at the beginning of the script is called a shebang and specifies the interpreter to be used to execute the script, which in this case is Bash.
	2. `for ip in` seq 1 254`; do`: This line starts a loop that iterates over a range of IP addresses from 1 to 254. The variable `ip` takes the values in this range for each iteration of the loop.
	3. `ping -c 1 192.168.4.$ip`: This line uses the `ping` command to send a single ICMP echo request to the IP address in the range specified by the variable `ip`. The `-c 1` option limits the number of pings to one.
	4. `grep "64 bytes"`: This line filters the output of the `ping` command to only keep the lines that contain the text "64 bytes". These lines indicate successful ping responses.
	5. `cut -d " " -f 4`: This line uses the `cut` command to extract the fourth field from each line, using a space (" ") as the delimiter. In this case, the fourth field contains the IP address.
	6. `tr -d ":"`: This line uses the `tr` command to delete any colons (":") from the output. This is useful in case the IP address includes colons.
	7. `done`: This line marks the end of the loop. <br>
	The script executes the ping command for each IP address in the range specified by the `seq` command. It filters the output to keep only the lines indicating successful pings, extracts the IP addresses from those lines, and removes any colons. The resulting IP addresses are printed as the output of the script.

###### IP Sweep Modified
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == ""] then
	echo "You forgot an IP Address"
	echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.4"
else
	for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
		ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d "" -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
	done
fi
```
**Explanation:**
	1. `if [ "$1" == "" ]; then`: This line checks if the first command-line argument (`$1`) is empty. The `$1` represents the first argument provided when running the script.
	2. `echo "You forgot an IP Address"`: If the first argument is empty, this line prints an error message indicating that an IP address is missing.
	3. `echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.4"`: This line provides the correct syntax for running the script, including an example IP address.
	4. `else`: This line starts the block of code that executes when a valid IP address is provided as a command-line argument.
	5. `for ip in` seq 1 254`; do`: This line remains the same as in the previous script, iterating over the range of IP addresses.
	6. `ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &`: The `$1` represents the base IP address provided as the command-line argument.
	7. `fi`: This line marks the end of the if-else condition. <br>
	With this modification, if the user forgets to provide an IP address as a command-line argument, an error message is displayed along with the correct syntax. Otherwise, the script proceeds to execute the IP sweeping functionality as before, using the base IP address provided as the argument.

###### Read IPs Saved from a Script (1 Liner Script)
```shell
$ ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.4 > ips.txt
$ for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do nmap $ip; done
```
**Explanation:**
	1. `./ipsweep.sh 192.168.4 > ips.txt`:
		- This command runs the `ipsweep.sh` script with the argument `192.168.4` and redirects the output to the file `ips.txt`.
		- The `ipsweep.sh` script generates a list of IP addresses and prints them to the standard output, which is then redirected to the file.
	2. `for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do nmap $ip; done`:
		- This command starts a loop that reads each IP address from the `ips.txt` file and performs an Nmap scan on it using the `nmap` command.
		- The `$(cat ips.txt)` portion reads the contents of the `ips.txt` file, and each IP address is stored in the `ip` variable for each iteration of the loop.
		- The `nmap $ip` command executes the Nmap scan on the current IP address.
	By combining these commands, you are generating a list of IP addresses using the `ipsweep.sh` script and then performing an Nmap scan on each IP address from the generated list.
