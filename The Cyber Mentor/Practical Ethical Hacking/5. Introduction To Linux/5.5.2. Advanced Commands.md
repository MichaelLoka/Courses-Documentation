### 1. ARP
The "arp" command in Linux is used to display and manage the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. ARP is responsible for mapping an IP address to a corresponding MAC address on a local network. Here's a detailed explanation of the "arp" command:

1. Basic usage: `arp [options]`
	- The "arp" command is followed by various options to perform specific operations related to ARP.
2. Examples:
	- To display the current ARP cache:
		- `$ arp`
	- To flush the ARP cache (clear all entries):
		- `$ sudo arp -d -a`
3. Options:
	- `-a`: Display the current ARP cache, showing the IP addresses and associated MAC addresses.
	- `-d`: Delete a specific ARP cache entry.
	- `-s <IP_address> <MAC_address>`: Manually add an entry to the ARP cache, associating an IP address with a MAC address.

### 2. Route
The "route" command in Linux is used to view and manipulate the IP routing table. It displays and manages the routing information for network traffic. Here's a detailed explanation of the "route" command:

1. Basic usage: `route [options]`
	- The "route" command is followed by various options to perform specific operations related to the IP routing table.
2. Examples:  
	- To display the current routing table:
		- `$ route`
	- To add a new route:
		- `$ sudo route add -net <network_address> netmask <netmask> gw <gateway_address> dev <interface>`
	- To delete a route:
		- `$ sudo route del -net <network_address> netmask <netmask> gw <gateway_address> dev <interface>`
3. Options:
	- `-n`: Display the routing table in numeric format, showing IP addresses instead of hostnames.
	- `add`: Add a new route to the routing table.
	- `del`: Delete a route from the routing table.
	- `-net <network_address>`: Specify the destination network address for the route.
	- `netmask <netmask>`: Specify the network mask for the destination network.
	- `gw <gateway_address>`: Specify the gateway address for the route.
	- `dev <interface>`: Specify the network interface associated with the route.

### 3. Netstat
The "netstat" command in Linux is used to display various network-related information, such as network connections, routing tables, network interfaces, and network statistics. It provides insights into the current state of network connections on a system. Here's a detailed explanation of the "netstat" command:

1. Basic usage: `netstat [options]`
	- The "netstat" command is followed by various options to specify the type of information to be displayed.
2. Examples:  
	- To display all active network connections:
		- `$ netstat -a`
	- To display listening (server) sockets:
		- `$ netstat -l`
	- To display network interface statistics:
		- `$ netstat -i`
3. Options: 
	- `-a` or `--all`: Display all sockets (both listening and established connections).
	- `-l` or `--listening`: Display only listening (server) sockets.
	- `-i` or `--interfaces`: Display network interface statistics.
	- `-r` or `--route`: Display the kernel routing table.
	- `-n` or `--numeric`: Display IP addresses and port numbers in numeric format, without hostname or service name resolution.
