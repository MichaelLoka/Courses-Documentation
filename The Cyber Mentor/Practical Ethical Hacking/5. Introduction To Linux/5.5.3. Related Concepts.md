### 1. Routing Table
A routing table is a data structure maintained by the operating system that contains information about the network topology and the available routes for forwarding network traffic. It serves as a roadmap for determining the path that network packets should follow to reach their destination.

1. Purpose:
	- Routing tables are used by routers and hosts to determine the next hop or destination for forwarding network packets.
	- They store information about network destinations, associated subnet masks, and the corresponding next-hop gateway or interface.
2. Structure:
	- A routing table consists of multiple entries, each representing a destination network or subnet.
	- Each entry typically includes the destination network address, subnet mask, next-hop gateway or interface, and sometimes additional information such as metrics or administrative distances.
3. Routing Decision:
	- When a packet is sent, the operating system or router looks up the destination IP address in the routing table.
	- It compares the destination IP address with the entries in the routing table to find the best match.
	- The routing table entry with the longest matching prefix (i.e., the most specific match) is chosen.
	- Based on the selected routing table entry, the system determines the next-hop gateway or interface for forwarding the packet.
4. Default Route:
	- A default route, often denoted as "0.0.0.0/0", is a special entry in the routing table.
	- It acts as a catch-all entry used when no more specific match is found for a destination IP address.
	- The default route typically points to the gateway that should be used when no other route matches.
5. Dynamic and Static Routing:
	- Routing tables can be populated dynamically through routing protocols, such as OSPF or BGP, which exchange routing information between routers.
	- Alternatively, static routes can be manually configured, allowing administrators to define specific routes that don't change.
6. View and Modification:
	- The routing table can be viewed and modified using commands such as "netstat -r" or "route" in Linux.
	- Network administrators configure routing tables to optimize network traffic flow, implement network segmentation, or control traffic paths.

### 2. ARP Poisoning
ARP poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing or ARP cache poisoning, is a type of attack where an attacker manipulates the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache of a network to redirect or intercept network traffic. It involves sending fake or malicious ARP messages to the target network devices, tricking them into associating incorrect MAC addresses with specific IP addresses. Here's an explanation of ARP poisoning:

1. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
	- ARP is a protocol used in local area networks (LANs) to map an IP address to a corresponding MAC address.
	- It allows devices to discover and communicate with each other on the same network segment.
2. How ARP Poisoning Works:
	- In an ARP poisoning attack, an attacker sends forged ARP messages to the target devices, pretending to be another legitimate device on the network.
	- The attacker typically sends ARP replies, claiming to have the MAC address of a specific IP address (such as the default gateway or a target device).
	- The target devices update their ARP cache with the fake mapping, associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address.
3. Goals of ARP Poisoning:
	- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): By poisoning the ARP cache of target devices, the attacker can intercept network traffic between the devices and potentially eavesdrop, modify, or inject malicious packets.
	- Session Hijacking: The attacker can redirect network traffic meant for a legitimate device to their own machine, allowing them to capture sensitive information or conduct further attacks.
4. Consequences of ARP Poisoning:
	- Unauthorized Network Monitoring: The attacker can capture network traffic, including sensitive data such as passwords, usernames, or financial information.
	- Denial of Service (DoS): By poisoning the ARP cache, the attacker can disrupt network communications, causing devices to lose connectivity or experience network performance issues.
	- Network Compromise: ARP poisoning can be a precursor to more advanced attacks, such as launching Man-in-the-Middle attacks or gaining unauthorized access to network resources.
5. Countermeasures:
	- Use ARP Spoofing Detection Tools: Various network monitoring tools can detect and alert administrators to ARP poisoning attacks on the network.
	- Static ARP Entries: Manually configure static ARP entries on critical devices to prevent them from accepting forged ARP replies.
	- Network Segmentation: Divide the network into smaller subnets or VLANs to minimize the impact of ARP poisoning attacks.
	- Network Encryption: Implement secure protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec to encrypt network traffic and protect against eavesdropping.
