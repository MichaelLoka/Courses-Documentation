Fuzzing is a technique used for automated and systematic testing of software applications to identify potential security flaws, such as buffer overflows, by feeding them with a large volume of random or specially crafted inputs. The goal of fuzzing is to discover unknown vulnerabilities that might not have been identified through manual code review or other testing techniques.

When it comes to buffer overflow fuzzing, the primary objective is to identify how the application behaves when it receives unexpected or excessively large input data. By doing so, fuzzing attempts to trigger buffer overflow conditions and observe the application's response. If the application crashes, behaves unexpectedly, or exhibits abnormal behavior, it suggests a possible buffer overflow vulnerability.

1. **Fuzzing Input Generation**: The fuzzer generates a large number of test cases, typically using random or mutated data. For buffer overflow testing, these inputs often consist of data that exceeds the expected size of input buffers, contains special characters, or is otherwise specifically designed to trigger boundary conditions.
2. **Input Injection**: The fuzzer sends the generated test cases as input to the target application, potentially overwriting buffers or causing unexpected memory accesses.
3. **Monitoring Application Behavior**: The fuzzer monitors the target application's behavior while processing the fuzzed input. It looks for signs of crashes, hangs, memory access violations, or other unusual behaviors that could indicate the presence of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
4. **Crash Analysis**: If the application crashes or behaves abnormally during the fuzzing process, the fuzzer records the input that caused the crash. This information is crucial for developers or security analysts to analyze and fix the underlying vulnerability.
5. **Iterative Process**: Fuzzing is an iterative process. The fuzzer continuously generates new inputs based on the results of previous tests, seeking to maximize the coverage of code paths and corner cases.

#### Fuzzing Script
```python
#!/usr/bin/python 
import sys, socket from time 
import sleep 

buffer = "A" * 100

while True:
	try:
		payload = "TRUN /.:/" + buffer 
		s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
		s.connect(('192.168.1.35',9999)) print ("[+] Sending the payload...\n" + str(len(buffer))) 
		
		s.send((payload.encode())) 
		s.close()
		sleep(1)
		buffer = buffer + "A"*100 
	except:
		print ("The fuzzing crashed at %s bytes" % str(len(buffer))) 
		sys.exit()
```
