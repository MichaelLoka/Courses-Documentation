Logical Active Directory components refer to the logical structure and organization of the Active Directory environment. These components define how the directory service is logically divided, organized, and managed. Logical Active Directory components include the following:

1. **Domains**: A domain is a logical container within Active Directory that represents a security boundary for a group of objects, including users, computers, and other resources. It provides a centralized management point for authentication and access control. Each domain has its own unique security policies and user accounts.<br>![[Domains.png]]
2. **Forest**: A forest is a collection of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. It is the top-level container in Active Directory and defines the security boundary for the entire organization. Forests are used to establish trust relationships between domains and manage the global directory information.<br>![[Forests.png]]
3. **Organizational Units (OUs)**: OUs are logical containers used to organize objects within a domain. They provide a hierarchical structure for managing and delegating administrative tasks. OUs allow administrators to apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to specific groups of objects and simplify the management of permissions and policies.<br>![[Organizational Units.png]]
4. **Trees and Child Domains**: A tree is a hierarchical grouping of domains within a forest. A tree is formed when multiple domains are created under a common root domain. Each domain in the tree is a child domain of the root domain. The tree structure allows for a logical and hierarchical organization of domains.<br>![[Trees.png]]
5. **Global Catalog (GC)**: The Global Catalog is a partial replica of all objects in the forest and contains a subset of attributes for each object. It is used to facilitate searches for objects across domains within the forest. One or more domain controllers in each domain hold the Global Catalog role.
6. **Trust Relationships**: Trust relationships define the ability of domains within a forest or across different forests to share authentication and access resources. Trusts allow users from one domain to access resources in another domain or forest.<br>![[Trusts.png]]
7. **Group Policy**: Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are used to define and enforce various settings and configurations on computers and users within the domain. Group Policy allows administrators to control security settings, desktop configurations, software installations, and more.
8. **Sites**: Sites are used to represent physical network locations within an Active Directory infrastructure. Sites help manage replication traffic, optimize authentication requests, and improve network performance for geographically distributed environments.
9. **Schema**: The schema defines the structure of the Active Directory database, including the classes of objects and their attributes. The schema is common across all domains in a forest and governs the types of objects that can be created.<br>![[Schema.png]]
10. **Objects**: Objects in Active Directory belong to these logical components, and they are organized and managed within these components. Each object in Active Directory represents a distinct entity, such as a user, computer, group, or organizational unit.<br>![[Objects.png]]
