Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft and is a crucial component of the Windows Server operating system. It is used to manage and organize resources within a network, providing centralized authentication, authorization, and directory services for users, computers, and other network objects.

1. **Domain Controller (DC)**: The Domain Controller is a Windows Server that runs the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role. It stores and manages the AD database, which includes information about users, groups, computers, and other network objects. Multiple domain controllers can be deployed to provide fault tolerance and load balancing.
2. **Domain**: A domain is a logical grouping of computers, users, and other network objects within an organization. It represents a security boundary where authentication and access control policies are enforced.
3. **Forest**: A forest is a collection of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. It is the top-level container in AD and represents the security boundary for the entire organization.
4. **Tree**: A tree is a group of one or more domains that share a contiguous namespace and trust relationship. A tree is formed when multiple domains are created under a common root domain.
5. **Organizational Units (OUs)**: OUs are containers used to organize objects within a domain. They provide a hierarchical structure that allows administrators to apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and delegate administrative permissions to specific areas of the AD.
6. **Users and Groups**: Active Directory stores information about users and groups. Users are individual network accounts associated with real people, while groups are collections of users used to assign permissions and access rights.
7. **Group Policy**: Group Policy is a powerful feature in Active Directory that allows administrators to define and enforce various settings and configurations on computers and users within the domain. These policies help ensure consistent security, networking, and application settings throughout the network.
8. **Global Catalog**: The Global Catalog (GC) is a specialized domain controller that contains a partial replica of all objects in the forest. It is used for searching and locating objects across domains within the forest.
9. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: AD uses LDAP as the protocol for accessing and managing directory information. LDAP provides a standard way to interact with the directory service.
10. **Trust Relationships**: Trust relationships define the ability of domains within a forest or across different forests to share authentication and access resources.

#### Types of Active Directory
1. **Physical Active Directory**: Physical Active Directory refers to the physical infrastructure and hardware components that make up the Active Directory environment. It involves the actual deployment and configuration of domain controllers, servers, network devices, and other physical resources required to run Active Directory services. Physical Active Directory includes the following components:
	- **Domain Controllers (DCs)**: These are the physical servers that host the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role. DCs store and manage the AD database, containing information about users, groups, computers, and other objects.
	- **Networking Equipment**: This includes switches, routers, and other network devices that facilitate communication between domain controllers and client machines.
	- **Storage Infrastructure**: Physical storage devices, such as hard disk drives and storage area networks (SANs), store the AD database and other related files.
	- **Physical Locations**: In larger organizations with geographically distributed offices, physical Active Directory may involve multiple data centers or sites with domain controllers located in different physical locations.
2. **Logical Active Directory**: Logical Active Directory refers to the logical structure and organization of the Active Directory environment. It focuses on the logical components, such as domains, forests, organizational units (OUs), and the hierarchical relationships between them. Logical Active Directory includes the following aspects:
	- **Domains**: Domains are logical containers used to organize and manage network resources. Each domain represents a security boundary and contains a specific set of user accounts, group policies, and other objects.
	- **Forests**: A forest is a logical collection of one or more domains that share a common schema and configuration. It represents the top-level container in Active Directory and establishes a trust relationship between domains.
	- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: OUs are logical containers used to organize objects within a domain. They provide a hierarchical structure that allows administrators to apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and delegate administrative permissions.
	- **Trust Relationships**: Logical Active Directory defines trust relationships between domains within a forest or across different forests, enabling users from one domain to access resources in another domain.
	**Note**
	- While Physical Active Directory focuses on the actual hardware and infrastructure, Logical Active Directory concentrates on the logical structure and organization of objects within the AD environment. Understanding both aspects is crucial for designing, implementing, and managing a successful Active Directory environment.
3. **Functional Active Directory**: Functional Active Directory refers to the various functional levels that can be set within an Active Directory environment. Functional levels determine the features and capabilities available to the domain or forest. The functional levels include:
	- **Domain Functional Level**: It sets the feature level for individual domains within a forest. Different Windows Server versions support different domain functional levels, and raising the functional level allows the use of newer features.
	- **Forest Functional Level**: It sets the feature level for the entire forest. Raising the forest functional level enables the use of advanced features that apply across all domains in the forest.
4. **Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODC)**: RODCs are a specialized type of domain controller introduced in Windows Server 2008. RODCs are deployed in locations with low physical security and provide read-only access to Active Directory information. They do not store a writeable copy of the AD database, which enhances security and minimizes the risk of data exposure in case of physical compromise.
5. **Child Domains and Parent Domains**: In Active Directory, domains can be organized in a hierarchical structure. A child domain is a subdomain created under a parent domain. The parent domain is at the top of the hierarchy, and each child domain has its own unique namespace. This hierarchical organization allows for easier administration and delegation of administrative tasks.
6. **Organizational Unit (OU) Types**: In Logical Active Directory, OUs can be classified into different types based on their purpose and usage:
	- **Default OUs**: Every domain has default OUs, such as "Users" and "Computers," created automatically during domain creation. Users, computers, and other objects are placed in these default OUs by default.
	- **Special-Purpose OUs**: These OUs are created to serve specific functions, such as Group Policy management or delegating administrative tasks. Administrators can create additional OUs to organize objects based on their requirements.
7. **Single Domain and Multi-Domain Forests**: Active Directory can be deployed as a single domain forest, where there is only one domain, or as a multi-domain forest, where there are multiple domains in a hierarchical structure. Multi-domain forests can span multiple geographical locations and facilitate more complex organizational structures.
8. **Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**: AD LDS, formerly known as Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM), is a lightweight and independent directory service that allows organizations to create directory solutions for specific applications or services without the need for a full AD DS deployment. AD LDS is used when separate directory partitions are required for different applications.
