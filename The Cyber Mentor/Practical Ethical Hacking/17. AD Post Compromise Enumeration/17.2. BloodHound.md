### Overview
**BloodHound** is an open-source tool used for Active Directory (AD) privilege escalation and Active Directory domain exploration. It is widely used by penetration testers, red teamers, and security professionals to identify and analyze attack paths in an AD environment. BloodHound helps in understanding the trust relationships, permissions, and access control within an AD domain, which can be crucial for identifying potential security risks and weaknesses.

#### Features
1. **Graph Visualization:** BloodHound creates a graph database of AD objects and their relationships, making it easy to visualize and analyze the trust paths and permissions in the domain.
2. **Attack Path Analysis:** BloodHound can identify and analyze the shortest paths to critical assets and high-privileged accounts, enabling users to identify possible attack paths an attacker could take.
3. **Principals and ACLs Mapping:** It maps Active Directory principals (users, groups, computers) to ACLs (Access Control Lists) on objects, providing insights into effective permissions.
4. **Session Collection:** BloodHound can collect session information from AD-joined systems, helping to identify which users have active sessions on machines.
5. **Data Collection Methods:** BloodHound uses various data collection methods, such as PowerShell remoting and DCOM, to gather information about AD objects and their relationships.
6. **Visual Query Language:** It offers a visual query language (Cypher) that allows users to write custom queries against the BloodHound graph database.
    
#### Usage
**BloodHound Ingestor:** The BloodHound Ingestor is responsible for collecting data from the AD environment and creating the graph database. The data collection methods can vary depending on the environment and the level of access available. The collected data includes information about users, groups, computers, permissions, ACLs, trusts, sessions, and more.
**BloodHound UI:** The BloodHound UI is a graphical interface used to visualize and analyze the data stored in the graph database. It provides an interactive graph view to explore the relationships between AD objects and discover potential attack paths.
    
1. **Download BloodHound:** You can download BloodHound from the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)
2. **Prepare the Environment:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to run BloodHound. If you are performing security assessments, make sure you have proper authorization to use BloodHound in the target AD environment.
3. **Collect Data:** Execute the BloodHound Ingestor on a machine with access to the AD environment. The Ingestor will collect the necessary data from the AD domain.
4. **Launch BloodHound UI:** Open the BloodHound UI and import the generated graph database (ZIP file) created by the Ingestor.
5. **Explore and Analyze:** Use the BloodHound UI to explore the graph, identify attack paths, analyze permissions, and search for potential security risks or privilege escalation opportunities.
6. **Write Custom Queries (Optional):** If needed, you can use BloodHound's visual query language (Cypher) to write custom queries against the graph database for specific investigations.

#### Setting Up
**Installation**
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install bloodhound
```
**Neo4J Setup**
```bash
$ neo4j console
```
1. Go to Localhost to access Neo4J Page
2. Connect using neo4j as username & password
3. Then Change it to new password
**Startup**
```bash
$ bloodhound
```
1. This will open Bloodhound
2. Type in the password the Connect

### Grabbing Data
#### Enumeration Step
- **Find Shortest Paths (Attack Paths):** BloodHound allows you to find the shortest paths to critical assets or high-privileged accounts. To do this, right-click on a user node, select "Find Shortest Paths to High Value Targets," and choose the target node (e.g., high-privileged user, sensitive group). BloodHound will then display the shortest paths an attacker could take to reach the target.
- **Find Local Admin Access:** BloodHound can identify machines where a user or group has local admin access. To do this, right-click on a user or group node, select "Find Local Admin Access," and BloodHound will highlight the machines with local admin access.
- **Find ACLs for Specific Objects:** You can search for Access Control Lists (ACLs) that include specific objects or properties. For example, you can right-click on a user node, select "Find All Object-Related ACEs," and BloodHound will display ACLs containing that user.
- **View Effective Access:** Right-click on a user node, select "View Object ACLs," and BloodHound will display the effective access of that user on the selected object.
- **Write Custom Queries (Optional):** BloodHound uses a visual query language called Cypher. You can write custom queries to retrieve specific data. Click on the "Queries" tab in the UI to access the Cypher query editor.

#### Setting Up
```bash
C:\Users\fcastle\Downloads> . .\SharpHound.ps1
C:\Users\fcastle\Downloads> Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Domain Marvel.local -ZipFileName file.zip
```
1. **SharpHound.ps1:**
	- The period (dot) and space at the beginning of the command, `. .\SharpHound.ps1`, are used to execute a PowerShell script located in the current directory (Downloads folder in this case).
	- The script being executed is **SharpHound.ps1**, which is part of the BloodHound project. It contains functions for data collection from Active Directory for further analysis.
	- Running this command imports the SharpHound module into the current PowerShell session, making its functions available for use.
2. **Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Domain Marvel.local -ZipFileName file.zip:**
	- The `Invoke-BloodHound` cmdlet is a function provided by the imported SharpHound module that starts the data collection process for BloodHound.
	- `-CollectionMethod All` specifies the data collection method to be used. In this case, `All` means that all available data collection methods will be executed. These methods include "Group", "Session", "LocalAdmin", "Trust", "ObjectProps", and "ACL". It ensures that all aspects of Active Directory will be assessed to gather comprehensive data.
	- `-Domain Marvel.local` specifies the Active Directory domain for data collection. Replace `Marvel.local` with the name of your target domain.
	- `-ZipFileName file.zip` specifies the name of the ZIP file where the collected data will be stored. In this example, the file will be named "file.zip". The data collected from Active Directory will be compressed and saved to this ZIP file for further analysis.
