[PowerView.ps1 File](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1)

### Overview
The "PowerView.ps1" file is indeed part of the PowerSploit repository, which is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for offensive security and penetration testing purposes. PowerView is specifically designed for Active Directory reconnaissance and exploitation.

**PowerView.ps1** is a script that contains various functions for querying and interacting with Active Directory domains. It allows security professionals and penetration testers to gather information about users, groups, computers, trusts, and other objects within an Active Directory environment. With this data, security practitioners can identify potential security weaknesses and perform privilege escalation, among other activities.

1. **Download PowerSploit:** Clone or download the PowerSploit repository from GitHub: [https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)
2. **Import the PowerView Module:** Open a PowerShell console and import the PowerView module by running the following command:
	```powershell
	Import-Module <path_to_PowerSploit_directory>\Recon\PowerView.ps1
	```
	- Replace `<path_to_PowerSploit_directory>` with the actual path to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the PowerSploit repository.
3. **Run PowerView Functions:** Once the module is imported, you can use various PowerView functions to query Active Directory. For example:
```powershell
# Get information about all user accounts in the domain
Get-NetUser

# Get information about all computer accounts in the domain
Get-NetComputer

# Find sensitive information, such as users with admin rights on machines
Find-LocalAdminAccess
```

### Domain Enumeration

Get-UserProperty
Get-UserProperty --Properties pwdlastset
Get-UserProperty --Properties logoncount
Get-NetComputer
Get-NetComputer -FullData
Get-NetComputer -FullData | select OperatingSystem
Get-NetGroup
Get-NetGroup -GroupName "Domain Admins"
Get-NetGroup -GroupName "admin"

#### Explanation
1. `powershell -ep bypass`: This is not a specific PowerView command, but rather a way to bypass PowerShell execution policy in order to run scripts without any restrictions. It allows you to execute PowerShell scripts, such as PowerView, even if the execution policy is set to "Restricted."
2. `.\PowerView.ps1`: This command executes the PowerView.ps1 script, importing the PowerView module and making its functions available in the current PowerShell session.
3. `Get-NetDomain`: This command retrieves information about the current domain, including its name, DNS name, and domain SID.
4. `Get-NetDomainController`: This command enumerates all domain controllers in the current domain, providing details such as their name, site, and whether they are writable.
5. `Get-DomainPolicy`: This command retrieves the default domain policy for the current domain, including various settings like password policy, account lockout policy, and Kerberos policy.
6. `(Get-DomainPolicy)."system access"`: This command displays information about the system access control for the domain, which includes settings like the "MaximumPasswordAge" and "MinimumPasswordAge."
7. `Get-NetUser`: This command enumerates all user accounts in the current domain, providing various details such as username, SID, and description.
8. `Get-NetUser | select cn`: This command retrieves and displays the "CommonName" attribute (cn) of all user accounts in the current domain.
9. `Get-NetUser | select description`: This command retrieves and displays the "Description" attribute of all user accounts in the current domain.
10. `Get-UserProperty`: This command enumerates all available properties for user objects in the current domain.
11. `Get-UserProperty --Properties pwdlastset`: This command retrieves the "pwdlastset" property for all user accounts in the domain, which indicates when the password was last set for each account.
12. `Get-UserProperty --Properties logoncount`: This command retrieves the "logoncount" property for all user accounts in the domain, indicating the number of times each user has logged on.
13. `Get-NetComputer`: This command enumerates all computer accounts in the current domain, providing various details such as hostname, OS, and description.
14. `Get-NetComputer -FullData`: This command retrieves extended information for all computer accounts, including operating system details, operating system service pack, and when the account was created.
15. `Get-NetComputer -FullData | select OperatingSystem`: This command retrieves and displays the "OperatingSystem" property for all computer accounts in the domain.
16. `Get-NetGroup`: This command enumerates all groups in the current domain, providing information such as group name, SID, and description.
17. `Get-NetGroup -GroupName "Domain Admins"`: This command retrieves information about the group "Domain Admins," including its members and group membership.
18. `Get-NetGroup -GroupName "admin"`: This command retrieves information about the group named "admin" in the current domain, including its members and group membership.
19. `Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "Domain Admins"`: This command enumerates the members of the group "Domain Admins," providing information about each member.
20. `Get-NetGPO`: This command enumerates all Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the current domain, providing details such as the GPO name, display name, and version.
21. `Get-NetGPO | select Displayname, whenchange`: This command retrieves and displays the "Displayname" and "whenchange" properties for all GPOs in the domain, indicating the last time each GPO was modified.
22. `Invoke-ShareFinder`: This command attempts to enumerate accessible shares on the local system and the network. It can help identify accessible file shares, which can be valuable for an attacker.
