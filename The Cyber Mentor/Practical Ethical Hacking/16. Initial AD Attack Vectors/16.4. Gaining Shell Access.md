### Pyexec.py
Psexec.py is a Python script that is part of the Impacket library, which is a collection of Python classes focused on working with network protocols. It provides functionalities to perform various network-related tasks, including remote code execution and SMB relay attacks, on Windows systems. The "psexec.py" script is inspired by the functionality of the original "psexec" tool from the Sysinternals suite, but implemented in Python.


1. **Installation**: To use "psexec.py," you need to install the Impacket library first. You can install it using `pip` by running the following command:
	```bash
	pip install impacket
	```
2. **Usage**: After installing Impacket, you can run "psexec.py" with the desired options to execute commands on a remote Windows system.
	```bash
	python psexec.py <target_host> <username> <password> [options] <command>
	```
	- `<target_host>`: The IP address or hostname of the target Windows system.
	- `<username>`: The username to authenticate with on the target system.
	- `<password>`: The corresponding password for the specified username.
	- `<command>`: The command you want to execute on the remote system.
3. **Examples**:
	```bash
	python psexec.py 192.168.1.100 Administrator Password123 ipconfig
	```
	- To execute a command that requires administrative privileges, use the "-hashes" option to provide the NTLM hash of the password (recommended for security):
	```bash
	python psexec.py 192.168.1.100 Administrator -hashes :<NTLM_hash> "net user new_user new_password /add"
	```
	- Note: Replace `<NTLM_hash>` with the NTLM hash of the specified password. You can obtain NTLM hashes using various tools like "Mimikatz" or "hashcat."
4. **Additional Options**: The "psexec.py" script provides additional options that you can explore using the "--help" flag.
	```bash
	python psexec.py --help
	```
