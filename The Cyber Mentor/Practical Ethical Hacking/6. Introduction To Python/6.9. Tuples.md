**Note: Tuples are Immutable (Can't be Changed)**
```python
grades = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f')
print(grades[1]) # b
```
### Tuple Properties
1. **Tuple Creation:**
	- Tuples are created by enclosing comma-separated elements within parentheses `()`.
	- `point = (3, 5)`
2. **Accessing Tuple Elements:**
	- Tuple elements can be accessed using their index, starting from `0` for the first element.
	- Negative indexing can be used to access elements from the end of the tuple.
```python
print(point[0])       # Output: 3 
print(point[-1])      # Output: 5
```
3. **Tuple Packing and Unpacking:**
	- Tuple packing is the process of creating a tuple by assigning multiple values to a single tuple variable.
	- Tuple unpacking allows you to assign individual tuple elements to separate variables.
```python
coordinates = 2, 4  # Tuple packing 
x, y = coordinates  # Tuple unpacking 
print(x, y)          # Output: 2 4
```
4. **Tuple Length:**
	- The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a tuple.
	- `print(len(point))     # Output: 2`
5. **Tuple Concatenation and Repetition:**
	- Tuples can be concatenated using the `+` operator to create a new tuple combining the elements of multiple tuples.
	- Tuples can be repeated using the `*` operator to create a new tuple with repeated elements.
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2) 
tuple2 = (3, 4) 
concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2 
repeated_tuple = tuple1 * 3 
print(concatenated_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4) 
print(repeated_tuple)       # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
```
