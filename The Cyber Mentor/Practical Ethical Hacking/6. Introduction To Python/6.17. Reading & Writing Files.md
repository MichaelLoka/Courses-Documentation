```python
months = open("months.txt")
# This Prints information about the file
print(months) # <_io.TextIOWrapper name='months.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'
months.close()

print(months.mode) # r
print(months.readable()) # True

print(months.read()) # Actual Content of the file
print(months.readline()) # The 1st line of the file

print(months.readlines()) # List of lines in the file
print(months.readlines()) # Empty List
# Because all the lines had been already read

# Solution
print(months.readlines())
months.seek(0)
print(months.readlines()) # Will be printed twice

for month in months
	print(month.strip()) # Removes Delimiter (New Line)
```

```python
days = open("days.txt", 'w')
print(days.mode) # w
days.close()

days.write("Monday")
days.write("\nTuesday") # This will Override Monday

# Solution
days = open("days.txt", 'a') # 'a' for append
```

### File Open Modes
1. **Read Modes:**
	- `'r'`: Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading.
	- `'rb'`: Read mode in binary. Opens the file for reading in binary mode.
2. **Write Modes:**
	- `'w'`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it will be truncated. If it doesn't exist, a new file will be created.
	- `'wb'`: Write mode in binary. Opens the file for writing in binary mode.
	- `'w+'`: Write and read mode. Opens the file for reading and writing. If the file exists, it will be truncated. If it doesn't exist, a new file will be created.
	- `'wb+'`: Write and read mode in binary. Opens the file for reading and writing in binary mode.
3. **Append Modes:**
	- `'a'`: Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but the file's contents are preserved. Data will be written at the end of the file.
	- `'ab'`: Append mode in binary. Opens the file for writing in binary mode, preserving the file's contents.
	- `'a+'`: Append and read mode. Opens the file for reading and writing. Data will be written at the end of the file.
	- `'ab+'`: Append and read mode in binary. Opens the file for reading and writing in binary mode.
4. **Exclusive Creation:**
	- `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file for writing but fails if the file already exists.

### Important File Methods
1. `open(file, mode)`: Opens a file in the specified mode and returns a file object.
2. `close()`: Closes the file when you're done working with it.
3. `read(size=-1)`: Reads and returns the contents of the file. If `size` is specified, it reads up to `size` bytes.
4. `readline()`: Reads and returns the next line from the file.
5. `readlines()`: Reads and returns a list of all lines in the file.
6. `write(string)`: Writes the given string to the file. Returns the number of characters written.
7. `writelines(list)`: Writes a list of strings to the file. No newline character is appended at the end of each string.
8. `seek(offset, from_what)`: Changes the file position to the given `offset`. The `from_what` parameter determines the reference position (0 for the beginning of the file, 1 for the current position, and 2 for the end of the file).
9. `tell()`: Returns the current file position.
10. `flush()`: Flushes the internal buffer, forcing data to be written to the file.
11. `truncate(size=None)`: Resizes the file to `size` bytes. If `size` is not specified, truncates the file at the current position.
12. `fileno()`: Returns the file descriptor (an integer) of the file. This is useful for low-level file operations.
13. `isatty()`: Returns True if the file is associated with a terminal device (TTY), otherwise returns False.
14. `encoding`: A file object attribute that indicates the encoding used to read or write the file. It can be accessed using `file.encoding`.
15. `errors`: A file object attribute that indicates the error handling scheme used during encoding and decoding operations. It can be accessed using `file.errors`.
16. `seekable()`: Returns True if the file supports random access (seeking), otherwise returns False.
17. `readinto(buffer)`: Reads up to the number of bytes specified in the `buffer` and stores the data in the given buffer. This is useful for binary data handling.
18. `readable()` and `writable()`: Methods that return a Boolean value indicating whether the file is readable or writable, respectively.
19. `isatty()`: Returns `True` if the file is associated with a terminal device (TTY), otherwise returns `False`.

### File Attributes
1. `name`: The file name that was passed to `open()` when the file object was created. It can be accessed using `file.name`.
2. `mode`: The mode in which the file was opened. It can be accessed using `file.mode`.
3. `closed`: A Boolean attribute that indicates whether the file is closed (`True`) or still open (`False`). It can be accessed using `file.closed`.
4. `buffer`: Returns the underlying buffer object for the file, if available. It allows accessing the file's buffer directly for more efficient I/O operations.
5. `newlines`: If Python is in universal newlines mode, this attribute will be `None`. Otherwise, it will be a string containing newline characters used to read the file (e.g., `'\n'`, `'\r'`, or `'\r\n'`).
6. `encoding`: The character encoding used to read or write the file. It can be accessed using `file.encoding`.
7. `errors`: The error handling scheme used during encoding and decoding operations. It can be accessed using `file.errors`
8. `line_buffering`: A Boolean attribute that indicates if line buffering is enabled (when the file is opened with `'r'` or `'w'` mode). If enabled, data is written to the file only when a newline character is encountered.
