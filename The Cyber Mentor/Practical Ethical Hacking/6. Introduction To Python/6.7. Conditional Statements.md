```python
def drink(money):
	if money >= 2:
		return "You 've got yourself a drink!"
	else:
		return "No drink for you!"

print(drink(3))
print(drink(1))
```

```python
def alcohol(age, money):
	if (age >= 21) and (money >= 5):
		return "We 're getting a drink!"
	elif (age >= 21) and (money < 5):
		return "Come back with more money!"
	elif (age < 21) and (money >= 5):
		return "Nice try, kid!"
	else:
		return "You 're too young and too poor!"

print(alcohol(21, 5)) # Case 1
print(alcohol(21, 4)) # Case 2
print(alcohol(20, 6)) # Case 3
print(alcohol(18, 3)) # Case 4
```

### Types of Statements
1. **If Statement:**
	- The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.
```python
x = 5 
if x > 0:
	print("x is positive")
```
2. **If-Else Statement:**
	- The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false.
```python
x = 5 
if x > 0:
	print("x is positive") 
else:
	print("x is non-positive")
``` 
3. **If-Elif-Else Statement:**
	- The `if-elif-else` statement allows you to evaluate multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the first condition that evaluates to true.
```python
x = 5 
if x > 0:
	print("x is positive") 
elif x < 0:
	print("x is negative") 
else:
	print("x is zero")
```
4. **Nested If Statements:**
	- You can nest conditional statements within each other to create more complex conditions.
```python
x = 5 
if x > 0:
	if x % 2 == 0:
		 print("x is positive and even")
	else:
		print("x is positive and odd") 
else:     
	print("x is non-positive")
```
5. **Ternary Operator:**
	- The ternary operator provides a concise way to write conditional expressions in a single line.
	- Syntax: `expression_if_true if condition else expression_if_false`
```python
x = 5 
result = "x is positive" if x > 0 else "x is non-positive" 
print(result)
``` 

**Note: Python has no switch case syntax**
