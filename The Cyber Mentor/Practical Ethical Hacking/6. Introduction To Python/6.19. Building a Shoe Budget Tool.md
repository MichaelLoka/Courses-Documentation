```python
# Define a class called Shoes
class Shoes:
    # The __init__ method is the constructor. 
    # It initializes the object with name and price attributes.
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = float(price)

    # Define a method to check if the budget is a valid number (int or float)
    def budget_check(self, budget):
        if not isinstance(budget, (int, float)):
            print("Invalid Entry, Please enter a Number")
            exit()  # Exit the program if the budget is not a valid number

    # Define a method to calculate the remaining budget after buying the shoes
    def change(self, budget):
        return budget - self.price

    # Define a method to buy the shoes, taking budget as an argument
    def buy(self, budget):
        self.budget_check(budget)  # Check if the budget is a valid number

        # Check if the budget is enough to buy the shoes
        if budget >= self.price:
            print(f"Congrats on the New Shoes {self.name}! Now you have {self.change(budget)} left in your account.")
        elif budget == self.price:
            print("You have exactly enough money.")
        else:
            print("Go get some money you poor piece of shit.")

# Exit the program with a farewell message
print("Thanks for using our shoe budget app!")

```
**Explanation:**
	1. We define a class called `Shoes`, which represents a shoe with a name and a price.
	2. The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class. It initializes the object with `name` and `price` attributes. The `name` is set to the value passed as `name`, and `price` is converted to a float using `float(price)`.
	3. The `budget_check` method checks if the provided budget is a valid number (integer or float). If the budget is not a number, it prints an error message and exits the program using `exit()`.
	4. The `change` method calculates the remaining budget after buying the shoes. It takes the `budget` as an argument and returns the difference between `budget` and `self.price`.
	5. The `buy` method is used to buy the shoes. It takes the `budget` as an argument.
	6. Inside the `buy` method, we call `budget_check` to ensure the `budget` is a valid number.
	7. We then check if the `budget` is greater than or equal to the `self.price`. If it is, we print a congratulatory message and display the remaining budget using the `change` method.
	8. If the `budget` is exactly equal to the `self.price`, we print a message indicating that the person has exactly enough money.
	9. If the `budget` is less than the `self.price`, we print a message telling the person to get more money.
	10. Finally, we print a farewell message outside the class using `print()` and exit the program.

```python
# Import the Shoes class from the Shoes.py file
from Shoes import Shoes

# Create instances of the Shoes class with different shoe names and prices
low = Shoes('Air 1s', 30)
medium = Shoes('Air Force 1s', 120)
high = Shoes('Off Whites', 400)

try:
    # Prompt the user to enter their shoe budget and convert the input to a float
    shoe_budget = float(input('What is your shoe budget? '))
except ValueError:
	# Exit the program if the user doesn't enter a valid number
    exit('Please enter a number')

# Iterate over the list of shoes (low, medium, high) and call the buy method for each shoe
for shoes in [high, medium, low]:
    shoes.buy(shoe_budget)

```
**Explanation:**
	1. We import the `Shoes` class from the `Shoes.py` file to use it in this script.
	2. We create three instances of the `Shoes` class: `low`, `medium`, and `high`, with different shoe names and prices.
	3. We use a try-except block to handle user input for the shoe budget. The user is prompted to enter their shoe budget, and the input is converted to a float. If the user enters something that cannot be converted to a float, a `ValueError` will be raised, and we exit the program with the message "Please enter a number."
	4. We then iterate over the list `[high, medium, low]`, which contains the shoe instances.
	5. For each shoe instance in the list, we call the `buy` method and pass the `shoe_budget` as an argument.
	6. Inside the `buy` method, it will check if the `shoe_budget` is enough to buy the particular shoe and provide the appropriate message about the purchase and the remaining budget.
