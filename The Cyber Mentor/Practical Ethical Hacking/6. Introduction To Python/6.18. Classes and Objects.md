```python
class Employee:
	def __init__(self, name, department, role, salary, years):
		self.name = name
		self.department = department
		self.role = role
		self.salary = salary
		self.years = years

	def eligible_for_retirement(self)
		if self.years >= 20:
			return True
		else:
			return False
```

```python
from Employee import Employee

e1 = Employee("Bob", "Sales", "Director of Sales", 10000, 20)
e2 = Employee("Linda", "Executive", "CIO", 15000, 14)

print(e1.name) # Bob
print(e2.role) # CIO
print(e1.eligible_for_retirement()) # True
```

### Classes & Objects Properties
#### Classes:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects that will be created based on it. A class can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that define the properties and actions of its objects.

To define a class in Python, use the `class` keyword, followed by the class name:
```python
class MyClass:
	# Class attributes and methods go here
```
#### Objects:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of the class with its unique data and behavior. Objects are created using the class as a constructor.

To create an object of a class, call the class name as if it were a function:
```python
# Creating an object of MyClass 
my_object = MyClass()
```
#### Class Attributes and Methods:
Class Attributes: Variables defined within a class, but outside any methods. They are shared among all instances of the class.
```python
class MyClass:
	class_attribute = 10  # Accessing the class attribute 

print(MyClass.class_attribute)  # Output: 10
```
Instance Attributes: Variables defined within the methods of a class and attached to specific objects. They hold data unique to each object.
```python
class MyClass:
	def __init__(self, value):         
		self.instance_attribute = value 
		
# Creating objects and accessing instance attributes 
obj1 = MyClass(42) 
obj2 = MyClass(100) 
print(obj1.instance_attribute)  # Output: 42 
print(obj2.instance_attribute)  # Output: 100
```
Class Methods: Methods defined within a class and accessed using the class itself. They don't operate on individual instances but can modify class-level attributes.
```python
class MyClass:
	class_attribute = 10
	
	@classmethod     
	def modify_class_attribute(cls, value):        
		cls.class_attribute = value  
		
# Modifying class_attribute using the class method
MyClass.modify_class_attribute(20) 
print(MyClass.class_attribute)  # Output: 20
```
Instance Methods: Methods defined within a class and accessed using individual instances. They can interact with instance attributes.
```python
class MyClass:
	def __init__(self, value):    
	    self.instance_attribute = value      
	     
	 def double_value(self):
		return self.instance_attribute * 2  
		
# Using an instance method 
obj = MyClass(5) 
result = obj.double_value() 
print(result)  # Output: 10
```
#### Constructor (`__init__`):
The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes. It is called automatically when an object is created and is used to initialize instance attributes.
```python
class MyClass:
	def __init__(self, value):         
		self.instance_attribute = value  
		
# Creating an object and initializing instance_attribute 
obj = MyClass(42) 
print(obj.instance_attribute)  # Output: 42
```

### Advanced Properties
1. **Class Inheritance (Subclassing):** Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass) that inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class (superclass). The subclass can also have additional attributes and methods of its own.
```python
class Animal:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
		
	def make_sound(self):
		pass  
		
class Dog(Animal):
	def make_sound(self):
		return "Woof!"  
		
dog = Dog("Buddy") 
print(dog.name)           # Output: Buddy 
print(dog.make_sound())   # Output: Woof!
```
2. **Method Overriding:** Subclasses can override methods of the superclass to provide their implementation. The overridden method in the subclass takes precedence.
```python
class Animal:
	def make_sound(self):
		return "Generic animal sound"  
		
class Dog(Animal):
	def make_sound(self):
		return "Woof!"
		
dog = Dog() 
print(dog.make_sound())   # Output: Woof!
```
3. **Multiple Inheritance:** A class can inherit from multiple superclasses. This allows you to combine functionalities from different classes.
```python
class Flyer:
	def fly(self):
		return "I'm flying!"  
		
class Swimmer:
	def swim(self):
		return "I'm swimming!"
		
class Duck(Flyer, Swimmer):
	pass
	 
duck = Duck()
print(duck.fly())    # Output: I'm flying! 
print(duck.swim())   # Output: I'm swimming!
```
4. **Class Variables vs. Instance Variables:** Class variables are shared among all instances of the class, while instance variables are specific to each object.
```python
class MyClass:
	class_variable = 0
	def __init__(self, value):
	     self.instance_variable = value
	     
obj1 = MyClass(42) 
obj2 = MyClass(100)

print(obj1.class_variable)       # Output: 0 
print(obj1.instance_variable)    # Output: 42 
print(obj2.class_variable)       # Output: 0 
print(obj2.instance_variable)    # Output: 100  

# Modifying class_variable affects all instances 
MyClass.class_variable = 10 
print(obj1.class_variable)       # Output: 10 
print(obj2.class_variable)       # Output: 10
```
5. **Static Methods:** Static methods are methods that don't operate on instance or class-level data. They are called using the class name and don't require the `self` or `cls` parameter.
```python
class MathUtils:
	@staticmethod
	def add(x, y):
		return x + y  
		
result = MathUtils.add(5, 3) 
print(result)    # Output: 8
```
6. **Class Properties:** Properties allow you to define getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes, making them behave like regular attributes while providing custom behaviors.
```python
class Circle:
	def __init__(self, radius):
		self._radius = radius
		
	@property
	def radius(self):
		return self._radius
		
	@radius.setter
	def radius(self, value):
		if value >= 0:
			self._radius = value
		else:
			raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative.")      
	@radius.deleter
	def radius(self):
		print("Deleting the radius.")
		del self._radius  
		
circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.radius)   # Output: 5  

circle.radius = 7 
print(circle.radius)   # Output: 7

del circle.radius      # Output: Deleting the radius.
```
