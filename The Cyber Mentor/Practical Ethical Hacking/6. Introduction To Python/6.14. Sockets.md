```python
import socket

# Home Address / Loopback Address
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 443

# AF_INET → IPv4 / SOCK_STREAM → Port
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))
```

```shell
# -n: No DNS Lookup (Name Resolution)
# -v: Verbose (More Information)
# -l: Listen Mode
# -p: Local Port

# Initiate a Port Listener
$ nc -nvlp 7777

# Connects to the Port Listener
$ python3 s.py
```

### Socket Properties
1. Create a socket object:
```python
# Create a TCP socket 
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  

# Create a UDP socket 
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
```
2. Set socket options (optional):
```python
# Enable reusing the address, useful for servers 
server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
```
3. Bind the socket (for server):
```python
# Bind the server socket to an address and port 
server_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 8080))
```
4. Listen for incoming connections (for server):
```python
# Listen for incoming connections (server socket) 
server_socket.listen()
```
5. Accept connections (for server):
```python
# Accept a client connection (blocks until a client connects) 
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
```
6. Connect to a server (for client):
```python
# Connect the client socket to a server 
client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 8080))
```
7. Send and receive data:
```python
# Sending data (for both server and client) 
client_socket.send(b'Hello, server!')  

# Receiving data (for both server and client) 
data = client_socket.recv(1024) 
print(data.decode())
```
8. Close the sockets when done:
```python
# Close the sockets 
server_socket.close() 
client_socket.close()
```

### Socket Functions
1. `socket()`: Creates a new socket object. It takes two arguments: `socket_family` (e.g., `socket.AF_INET` for IPv4) and `socket_type` (e.g., `socket.SOCK_STREAM` for TCP, `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` for UDP).
2. `bind(address)`: Binds the socket to a specific address (host and port) on the local machine. Used by server sockets to specify the address to listen for incoming connections.
3. `listen(backlog)`: Puts the server socket in listening mode, allowing it to accept incoming client connections. `backlog` specifies the maximum number of queued connections.
4. `accept()`: Accepts an incoming client connection and returns a new socket object representing the connection, along with the client address.
5. `connect(address)`: Connects the client socket to a specific address (host and port) of a remote server.
6. `send(data)`: Sends data over the socket. For TCP sockets, the data is sent as a byte string. For UDP sockets, the data can be sent as a byte string or a string.
7. `recv(bufsize)`: Receives data from the socket. `bufsize` specifies the maximum number of bytes to receive. Returns the received data as a byte string.
8. `setsockopt(level, option, value)`: Sets socket options to control various socket behaviors. Commonly used to set options like `SO_REUSEADDR`, `SO_BROADCAST`, etc.
9. `getsockopt(level, option)`: Retrieves the value of a socket option.
10. `close()`: Closes the socket, releasing its resources. It's essential to close sockets when they are no longer needed.
