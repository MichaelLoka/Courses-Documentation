```python
vegetables = ["cucumber", "spinach", "cabbage"]
for x in vegetable:
	print(x)
```

```python
for ip in range(254):
	ping 192.168.1.ip
```

```python
i = 1
while i < 10:
	print(i)
	i += 1
```

### Types of Loops
#### For Loop Variations:
1. **Looping Over a Sequence:**
	- You can loop over a sequence (list, tuple, string) directly using a `for` loop.
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] 
for fruit in fruits:
	print(fruit)
```
2. **Looping Over a Range with Step Size:**
	- The `range()` function allows specifying a step size to increment the loop variable.
```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
	print(i)
``` 
3. **Looping Over a Reversed Sequence:**
	- You can loop over a sequence in reverse order using the `reversed()` function.
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] 
for fruit in reversed(fruits):
	print(fruit)
```
4. **Looping Over Enumerated Sequence:**
	- You can access both the index and value of each item in a sequence using the `enumerate()` function.
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] 
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):     
	print(index, fruit)
```
#### While Loop Variations:
1. **Loop with Condition at the Beginning:**
	- In this variation, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop before executing the code block.
```python
count = 0 
while count < 5:
	print(count)     
	count += 1
```
2. **Loop with Condition in the Middle:**
	- In this variation, the condition is checked in the middle of the loop, allowing the code block to execute at least once.
```python
count = 0 
while True:     
	print(count)     
	count += 1     
	if count >= 5:
		 break
 ```
3. **Loop with Multiple Exit Conditions:**
	- You can use multiple conditions to control when to exit the loop using the `break` statement.
```python
count = 0 
while True:
	print(count)
	count += 1
	if count >= 5:
		 break
	if count % 2 == 0:
		 break
 ```
4. **Loop with Continue Statement:**
	- The `continue` statement allows you to skip the rest of the code block and move to the next iteration based on a condition.
```python
count = 0 
while count < 5:
	count += 1
	if count % 2 == 0:
		continue
	print(count)
```
