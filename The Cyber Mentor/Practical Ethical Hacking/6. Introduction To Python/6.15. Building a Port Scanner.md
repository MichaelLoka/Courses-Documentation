```python
# For accessing command-line arguments
import sys
# For working with sockets
import socket
# For getting the current time
from datetime import datetime  
```
**Explanation:**
	1. `import sys`: Import the `sys` module, which provides access to command-line arguments and other system-specific functionalities.
	2. `import socket`: Import the `socket` module, which allows working with sockets for network communication.
	3. `from datetime import datetime`: Import the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module to work with dates and times.

```python
# If there's exactly one command-line argument, use it as the target
# Translate the hostname to an IPv4 address
# If no or more than one argument is provided, print an error message and exit the program

#Define our target 
if len(sys.argv) == 2: 
	#Translate hostname to IPv4 
	target = socket.gethostbyname(sys.argv[1]) 
else: 
	print("Invalid amount of arguments.") 
	print("Syntax: python3 scanner.py") 
```
**Explanation:**
	1. Check command-line arguments: The code checks if there's exactly one command-line argument (excluding the script name itself). If so, it assumes the argument is the hostname or IP address to scan.
	2. `socket.gethostbyname(sys.argv[1])`: Translate the hostname provided as a command-line argument to an IPv4 address using `socket.gethostbyname()`. This function resolves the hostname to its corresponding IP address.
	3. If the number of command-line arguments is not exactly one, print an error message indicating the correct syntax and exit the program.

```python
# Add a pretty banner
# Print a banner to indicate the target and the start time of the scan
print("-" * 50) 
print("Scanning target "+target) p
rint("Time started: "+str(datetime.now())) 
print("-" * 50) 
```
**Explanation:**
	1. Print a banner: Output a banner to the console to indicate the target host and the start time of the scan. The banner consists of a line of 50 dashes (`-`), followed by the target host, the current date and time obtained using `datetime.now()`, and another line of 50 dashes.

```python
try:
    # Loop through the range of ports from 50 to 84 (inclusive)
    for port in range(50, 85):
        # Create a socket object for a TCP connection
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        
        # Set the timeout for the connection attempt to 1 second
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(1)
        
        # Attempt to establish a connection to the target and port
        # If the connection is successful (port is open), it returns 0
        # If the connection fails (port is closed or filtered), it returns an error indicator (1)
        result = s.connect_ex((target, port))
        
        # Check if the connection attempt was successful (port is open)
        if result == 0:
            print("Port {} is open".format(port))
        
        # Close the socket
        s.close()

# Handle KeyboardInterrupt (e.g., when the user presses Ctrl+C) to gracefully exit the program
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nExiting program.")
    sys.exit()

# Handle socket-related exceptions
except socket.gaierror:
    print("Hostname could not be resolved.")
    sys.exit()

# Handle Connection Error when the server is not up for working
except socket.error:
    print("Could not connect to server.")
    sys.exit()
```
**Explanation:**
	1. try-except block: Wrap the scanning code in a try-except block to handle potential exceptions.
	2. `for port in range(50, 85)`: Iterate through a range of port numbers, from 50 to 84 (inclusive). These are the ports that the program will attempt to scan.
	3. `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`: Create a new socket object for a TCP connection using `socket.AF_INET` (IPv4) and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` (TCP) as arguments.
	4. `socket.setdefaulttimeout(1)`: Set the default timeout for socket operations to 1 second. This means if the connection attempt takes longer than 1 second, the program will move on to the next port.
	5. `s.connect_ex((target, port))`: Attempt to establish a connection to the target host and port. `connect_ex()` returns an error indicator. If the connection is successful (port is open), it returns 0. If the connection fails (port is closed or filtered), it returns an error code.
	6. If `result == 0`, the connection was successful, so print a message indicating that the port is open.
	7. Close the socket after the connection attempt, regardless of success or failure.
	8. Handle KeyboardInterrupt: If the user interrupts the program (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), print a message and exit the program gracefully using `sys.exit()`.
	9. Handle `socket.gaierror`: If there's an error resolving the hostname, print an error message and exit the program.
	10. Handle `socket.error`: If there's an error connecting to the target server (e.g., if it's not reachable), print an error message and exit the program.
