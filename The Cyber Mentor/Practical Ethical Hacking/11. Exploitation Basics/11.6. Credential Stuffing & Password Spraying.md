### Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack where attackers use automated tools to systematically and rapidly try large sets of username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on various online platforms. This attack relies on the fact that many users reuse the same credentials (username/password) across multiple websites and services.

#### Attack Process
1. **Compromised Credentials:** Attackers often obtain lists of username and password pairs from previous data breaches or leaks from various sources on the internet. These lists may contain millions of credential pairs.
2. **Automated Login Attempts:** Attackers use automated scripts or tools to feed these username/password combinations into the login page of the targeted website or application.
3. **Reusing Credentials:** Since many users reuse the same passwords across multiple platforms, attackers are hoping that some of the credentials from the list will match with user accounts on the target site.
4. **Account Takeover:** If the attacker finds a matching username/password combination, they gain unauthorized access to the user's account. They can then potentially perform various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, making unauthorized purchases, or causing harm to the account owner.

#### How to Mitigate
**For Users:**
	1. **Use Unique Passwords:** Avoid reusing passwords across different websites and services. Use strong and unique passwords for each account.
	2. **Password Managers:** Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for different services.
	3. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA whenever possible, as it adds an additional layer of security to your accounts.

**For Service Providers:**
	1. **Account Lockouts and Rate Limiting:** Implement account lockout policies and rate limiting to prevent attackers from making multiple login attempts in quick succession.
	2. **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Regularly monitor login attempts and detect unusual patterns that might indicate a credential stuffing attack.
	3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Encourage users to enable 2FA to provide an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.

### Password Stuffing
Password spraying is a type of cyberattack where attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to multiple user accounts by trying a small number of commonly used passwords against many accounts. Unlike traditional brute force attacks, where attackers try many passwords against a single account, password spraying involves trying a few passwords across many accounts, making it a more stealthy approach.

#### Attack Process
1. **Target Identification:** Attackers identify the target organization, such as a company or a service provider, and the authentication portal (e.g., login page) they want to attack.
2. **Password Selection:** Instead of trying multiple passwords against a single account, attackers use a shortlist of commonly used passwords. These could be passwords like "password," "123456," "admin," "qwerty," etc.
3. **Username Enumeration:** Attackers may attempt to gather valid usernames or emails associated with the target organization. This can be done through various methods like public information, social engineering, or data leaks from previous breaches.
4. **Password Spraying Attack:** Armed with a list of common passwords and a set of usernames, the attackers try these passwords against multiple accounts in the organization's login portal. They try to avoid account lockouts or detection by making only a few login attempts per account.
5. **Account Takeover:** If the attackers find any accounts with weak passwords, they gain unauthorized access to those accounts, allowing them to potentially steal sensitive information, gain deeper access to the organization's systems, or perform other malicious activities.
    
#### How to Mitigate
1. **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies that require users to create complex and unique passwords.
2. **Account Lockouts and Rate Limiting:** Implement account lockout and rate-limiting mechanisms to block multiple login attempts from the same IP address.
3. **User Education:** Educate users about the importance of using strong and unique passwords for each account and the risks associated with password reuse.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Encourage or enforce the use of MFA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
5. **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Regularly monitor login attempts and look for unusual patterns that might indicate password spraying attacks.
