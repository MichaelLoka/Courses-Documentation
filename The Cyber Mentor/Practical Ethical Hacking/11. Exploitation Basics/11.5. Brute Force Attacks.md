### Hydra
Hydra is a popular and powerful open-source tool used for online password-cracking and brute force attacks. It is designed to perform rapid dictionary attacks against various protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, and more. Hydra supports multiple attack modes and can be used for both legitimate purposes (like security testing by system administrators) and malicious activities (when used without proper authorization).

1. **Installation:** 
	- Hydra is typically available in most Linux distributions and can be installed using package managers like apt or yum. Alternatively, you can download it from the GitHub repository.
2. **Command Syntax:**
	```bash
	hydra -L <USER_LIST> -P <PASSWORD_LIST> <TARGET> <PROTOCOL>
	```
	- `-L`: Specify the list of usernames (one per line) to try during the attack.
	- `-P`: Specify the list of passwords (one per line) to try during the attack.
	- `<TARGET>`: Specify the target host or IP address.
	- `<PROTOCOL>`: Specify the protocol to attack, e.g., http, ftp, ssh, etc.
3. **Example Usage:** 
	- As an example, let's say you want to perform a brute force attack on an FTP server with Hydra. You have a list of usernames in "users.txt" and a list of passwords in "passwords.txt". The target server's IP address is "192.168.1.100" and runs an FTP service.
	```bash
	hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.100 ftp
	```
	- Hydra will then try all combinations of usernames and passwords from the provided lists until it finds the correct credentials or exhausts all possibilities.
4. **Other Options:**
	- Hydra offers various options and flags to customize the attack, such as specifying a specific port, setting time delays between attempts, using different attack modes, etc. You can check the Hydra documentation or run hydra --help to see all available options.

```bash
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Syntax: hydra [[[-l LOGIN|-L FILE] [-p PASS|-P FILE]] | [-C FILE]] [-e nsr] [-o FILE] [-t TASKS] [-M FILE [-T TASKS]] [-w TIME] [-W TIME] [-f] [-s PORT] [-x MIN:MAX:CHARSET] [-c TIME] [-ISOuvVd46] [-m MODULE_OPT] [service://server[:PORT][/OPT]]

Options:
  -R        restore a previous aborted/crashed session
  -I        ignore an existing restore file (dont wait 10 seconds)
  -S        perform an SSL connect
  -s PORT   if the service is on a different default port, define it here
  -l LOGIN or -L FILE  login with LOGIN name, or load several logins from FILE
  -p PASS  or -P FILE  try password PASS, or load several passwords from FILE
  -x MIN:MAX:CHARSET  password bruteforce generation, type "-x -h" to get help
  -y        disable use of symbols in bruteforce, see above
  -r        use a non-random shuffling method for option -x
  -e nsr    try "n" null password, "s" login as pass and/or "r" reversed login
  -u        loop around users, not passwords (effective! implied with -x)
  -C FILE   colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of -L/-P options
  -M FILE   list of servers to attack, one entry per line, ':' to specify port
  -o FILE   write found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout
  -b FORMAT specify the format for the -o FILE: text(default), json, jsonv1
  -f / -F   exit when a login/pass pair is found (-M: -f per host, -F global)
  -t TASKS  run TASKS number of connects in parallel per target (default: 16)
  -T TASKS  run TASKS connects in parallel overall (for -M, default: 64)
  -w / -W TIME  wait time for a response (32) / between connects per thread (0)
  -c TIME   wait time per login attempt over all threads (enforces -t 1)
  -4 / -6   use IPv4 (default) / IPv6 addresses (put always in [] also in -M)
  -v / -V / -d  verbose mode / show login+pass for each attempt / debug mode 
  -O        use old SSL v2 and v3
  -K        do not redo failed attempts (good for -M mass scanning)
  -q        do not print messages about connection errors
  -U        service module usage details
  -m OPT    options specific for a module, see -U output for information
  -h        more command line options (COMPLETE HELP)
  server    the target: DNS, IP or 192.168.0.0/24 (this OR the -M option)
  service   the service to crack (see below for supported protocols)
  OPT       some service modules support additional input (-U for module help)
