Google Dorking, also known as Google Hacking or Google-Fu, refers to using advanced operators and search techniques to find sensitive or hidden information on the internet using Google's search engine. It involves crafting specialized search queries to pinpoint specific types of data that may not be easily accessible through regular searches.

While Google Dorking can be used by security professionals for legitimate purposes like finding publicly exposed sensitive information and performing security assessments, it can also be misused for illegal activities such as hacking or data breaches. As a result, it is essential to use Google Dorking responsibly and ethically.

1. **Finding Sensitive Files**:
    - Query: `filetype:pdf site:example.com confidential`
    - Description: This search targets PDF files containing the word "confidential" on the website example.com. It may reveal confidential documents that should not be publicly accessible.
2. **Finding Vulnerable Webcams**:
    - Query: `inurl:viewerframe?mode=`
    - Description: This search looks for webcams using the insecure "viewerframe" mode, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to live camera streams.
3. **Directory Listing**:
    - Query: `intitle:"index of" site:example.com`
    - Description: This search may reveal directory listings on the website example.com, potentially exposing sensitive files and data.
4. **Exposing Login Credentials**:
    - Query: `intitle:"login" "username" "password"`
    - Description: This search targets web pages with login forms where the page titles contain the words "login," "username," and "password," which may expose login credentials.
5. **Finding Vulnerable Servers**:
    - Query: `intitle:"Apache Tomcat" intitle:"status"`
    - Description: This search targets pages related to Apache Tomcat status, which could indicate the presence of a vulnerable server.
6. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**:
    - Query: `inurl:index.php?id= site:example.com`
    - Description: This search attempts to find pages on example.com that use the "index.php" script with a parameter named "id," which may indicate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
7. **Finding Open Directories**:
    - Query: `intitle:"index of" -inurl:(htm|html|php) site:example.com`
    - Description: This search is used to discover open directories on the website example.com that do not contain HTML or PHP files.

#### Operators
##### Search Term
This operator searches for the exact phrase within speech marks only. This is ideal when the phrase you are using to search is ambiguous and could be easily confused with something else, or when you’re not quite getting relevant enough results back. For example:
```
"Tinned Sandwiches"
```
##### OR
This self explanatory operator searches for a given search term OR an equivalent term.
```
site:facebook.com | site:twitter.com
```
##### AND
```
site:facebook.com & site:twitter.com
```
##### Operators combination
```
(site:facebook.com | site:twitter.com) & intext:"login"
(site:facebook.com | site:twitter.com) (intext:"login")
```
##### Include results
This will order results by the number of occurrence of the keyword.
```
-site:facebook.com +site:facebook.*
```
##### Exclude results
```
site:facebook.* -site:facebook.com
```
##### Synonyms
Adding a tilde to a search word tells Google that you want it to bring back synonyms for the term as well. For example, entering “~set” will bring back results that include words like “configure”, “collection” and “change” which are all synonyms of “set”. Fun fact: “set” has the most definitions of any word in the dictionary.
```
~set
```
##### Glob pattern `(*)`
Putting an asterisk in a search tells Google ‘I don’t know what goes here’. Basically, it’s really good for finding half remembered song lyrics or names of things.
```
site:*.com
```
