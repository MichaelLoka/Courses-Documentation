Email discovery is an essential phase in a penetration test (pentest) or security assessment. It involves gathering information related to email systems, users, and configurations that can help the penetration tester identify potential attack vectors and weaknesses. Here's a step-by-step guide on email discovery during a penetration testing:
1. **Passive Information Gathering:**
    - Use search engines and public databases to collect information about the target organization, such as domain names, email addresses, employee names, and any publicly available information related to their email systems.
2. **Email Enumerating Tools:**
    - Utilize email enumeration tools like "theHarvester," "Maltego," or "Harvestor.io" to find email addresses associated with the target domain. These tools may leverage various sources like search engines, public records, and social media to compile email lists.
3. **DNS Enumeration:**
    - Perform DNS enumeration to discover email-related records, such as Mail Exchange (MX) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records. This can reveal the mail servers used by the organization and potentially indicate email security measures in place.
4. **SMTP Banner Grabbing:**
    - Use Telnet or specialized tools like "SMTP User Enum" to connect to the target's mail server and perform banner grabbing. This can reveal useful information about the email server's software, version, and configurations.
5. **Email Username Enumeration:**
    - Attempt to enumerate valid email addresses by using techniques like guessing common usernames or using a tool like "smtp-user-enum." This can help identify valid email accounts for further exploitation.
6. **Email Spoofing and Phishing Testing:**
    - Test the organization's susceptibility to email spoofing and phishing attacks. This involves crafting and sending test emails to employees to see if they fall for these simulated attacks. However, ensure this is done ethically and with proper authorization.
7. **Password Policies and Account Lockout Testing:**
    - Test the email system's password policies, such as password complexity requirements and account lockout mechanisms, to identify any potential weaknesses that could be exploited.
8. **Testing Email Forwarding Rules:**
    - Check for email forwarding rules on internal email accounts to see if any unauthorized forwarding is enabled, potentially leaking sensitive information.
9. **Testing for Email Vulnerabilities:**
    - Evaluate the email system for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software versions, misconfigurations, or insecure email protocols like IMAP and POP3.
10. **Social Engineering Assessments:**
    - Perform social engineering tests, such as phishing or pretexting, to see if employees willingly share sensitive information like email credentials.
11. **Analyzing Spam Filters:**
    - If possible, assess the effectiveness of the organization's spam filters and email security measures to determine their susceptibility to spam and phishing emails.
