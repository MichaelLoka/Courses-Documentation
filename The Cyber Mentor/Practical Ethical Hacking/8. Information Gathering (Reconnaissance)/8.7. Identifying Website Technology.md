### Wappalyzer
Wappalyzer is a technology profiler and recognition tool that helps you identify the technologies used in building a specific website. It's available as a browser extension for popular browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, as well as a web-based tool.

1. **Installation**:    
	- Browser Extension: To use Wappalyzer as a browser extension, you need to visit the respective extension store (Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome, Add-ons store for Firefox, or Microsoft Edge Add-ons) and search for "Wappalyzer." Then, click on the "Add to Chrome" (or the corresponding button for your browser) to install the extension.
	- Web-based Tool: To use Wappalyzer as a web-based tool, you can visit the official Wappalyzer website ([https://www.wappalyzer.com/](https://www.wappalyzer.com/)) and enter the URL of the website you want to analyze.
2. **Website Analysis**:
	- Browser Extension: Once the extension is installed, you'll see the Wappalyzer icon in your browser's toolbar. When you visit any website, click on the Wappalyzer icon, and it will display a dropdown showing the technologies detected on that website.
	- Web-based Tool: If you are using the web-based tool, go to the Wappalyzer website, enter the URL of the website you want to analyze in the search bar, and click the "Lookup" button.
3. **Results**:
	- Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, etc.
	- Web Frameworks and Libraries like React, Angular, jQuery, etc.
	- E-commerce Platforms like WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento, etc.
	- Programming Languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.
	- Web Servers like Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.
	- Analytics Tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.
4. **Detailed Information**: 
	- Clicking on each technology in the Wappalyzer results will often provide more detailed information about the specific version of the technology being used. It also may provide links to official websites or additional resources related to that technology.
5. **Use Cases**:
	- **Web Development**: It helps developers quickly understand the tech stack of a website they are working on or inspecting, enabling them to make informed decisions during development.
	- **Competitor Analysis**: Marketers and business analysts can use Wappalyzer to identify the technologies used by their competitors to gain insights into their strategies and tools.
	- **Security and Research**: Security researchers can use Wappalyzer to identify the technologies used on a website, which can help in vulnerability assessment and security analysis.

### WhatWeb
WhatWeb is a reconnaissance tool used in Linux for identifying and fingerprinting web technologies used by a website. It is designed to extract as much information as possible from a web server, helping to determine the software stack, frameworks, and other components being used.

1. **Installation**: WhatWeb is a Ruby-based tool, so you need to have Ruby installed on your Linux system. If you don't have it, install Ruby using your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, you can run:
```bash
sudo apt update sudo apt install ruby
```
Once you have Ruby installed, you can install WhatWeb using RubyGems:
```bash
sudo gem install whatweb
```
2. **Usage**: Using WhatWeb is straightforward. Open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
whatweb [options] [URL]
```
Replace `[URL]` with the URL of the website you want to analyze. For example, to scan the website "example.com," you would run:
```bash
whatweb example.com
```
3. **Options**: WhatWeb has several options to customize its behavior. Some common options include:
	- `-h`: Display the help message and usage information.
	- `--color`: Enable colored output (useful for easier identification of technologies).
	- `-a`: Perform aggressive identification by enabling plugins and performing more extensive checks.
	- `--quiet`: Suppress output, displaying only the essential information.
	- `--log-json [filename]`: Save the results in JSON format to the specified file.
4. **Interpreting the Results**: 
	- WhatWeb will start analyzing the website and display the results on the terminal. It will show the detected technologies and their versions. The output might include information about web servers, content management systems, programming languages, web frameworks, and more.
	- The results can be quite extensive, so you might want to redirect the output to a file or use other tools like `grep` to search for specific information.
5. **Example**: 
	- Let's say you want to analyze the website "example.com" using aggressive scanning and save the results to a JSON file. You would run the following command:
```bash
whatweb -a --log-json output.json example.com
```
The results will be saved in a file named "output.json" in the current directory.
