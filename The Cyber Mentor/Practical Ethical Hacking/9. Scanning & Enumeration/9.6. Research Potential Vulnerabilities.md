### Exploit Database
Exploit Database (ExploitDB) is a popular online repository of security-related exploits and vulnerabilities. It provides a collection of publicly disclosed exploits, security papers, shellcodes, and other relevant information related to software vulnerabilities. The Exploit Database is a valuable resource for security researchers, penetration testers, and cybersecurity professionals to find and study exploits to better understand vulnerabilities and enhance security measures.

1. **Access Exploit Database:** You can access the Exploit Database website by visiting: [https://www.exploit-db.com/](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
2. **Search for Exploits:** On the main page, you'll find a search bar. You can use keywords, software names, or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers to search for specific exploits or vulnerabilities.
3. **Browse Exploits:** You can also browse the exploits by clicking on the "Exploits" tab on the top navigation menu. This will show you the latest exploits added to the database.
4. **View Exploit Details:** Clicking on an exploit's title will take you to the details page. Here, you'll find information about the vulnerability, the affected software, a description of the exploit, and the proof-of-concept code.
5. **Download Exploits:** On the exploit's details page, you can find a link to download the exploit code. You should exercise caution when downloading and using these exploits, as they can be potentially harmful if used irresponsibly or on unauthorized systems.
6. **Read Security Papers and Shellcodes:** In addition to exploits, Exploit Database also provides security papers and shellcodes that can be useful for learning and research purposes.

### Searchsploit
Searchsploit is a command-line utility that comes bundled with the popular exploitation framework Metasploit. It is used to search the Exploit Database (ExploitDB) directly from the terminal. Searchsploit allows users to quickly find information about known exploits, security vulnerabilities, shellcodes, and related information.

1. **Open Terminal:** First, open a terminal on your Linux system. Searchsploit is typically available on Linux distributions with Metasploit installed.
2. **Update Searchsploit Database:** Before using Searchsploit, it's a good idea to update its local exploit database. Use the following command to update Searchsploit:
	```bash
	searchsploit -u
	```
3. **Search for Exploits:** To search for a specific exploit or vulnerability, use the following command:
	```bash
	searchsploit <keyword>
	```
	- Replace `<keyword>` with the term you want to search for. For example, if you want to search for exploits related to "Apache," you would use:
	```bash
	searchsploit Apache
	```
4. **View Exploit Details:** Once you execute the search, Searchsploit will display a list of matching exploits along with their IDs, descriptions, and paths. To view the details of a specific exploit, note down its ID (e.g., "Exploit: 12345") and use the following command:
	```bash
	searchsploit -x 12345
	```
	- Replace "12345" with the actual exploit ID from the search results.
5. **Copy Exploit to Local Directory:** If you want to copy the exploit file to your current working directory, use the following command:
	```bash
	searchsploit -m 12345
	```
	- This will copy the exploit file associated with ID "12345" to your current directory.
6. **Update Searchsploit Database Periodically:** The Exploit Database is continuously updated with new exploits and vulnerability information. Therefore, it's essential to update the local Searchsploit database periodically using the command mentioned in step 2.

=========
 Options 
=========
## Search Terms
   -c, --case     [term]      Perform a case-sensitive search (Default is inSEnsITiVe)
   -e, --exact    [term]      Perform an EXACT & order match on exploit title (Default is an AND match on each term) [Implies "-t"]
                                e.g. "WordPress 4.1" would not be detect "WordPress Core 4.1")
   -s, --strict               Perform a strict search, so input values must exist, disabling fuzzy search for version range
                                e.g. "1.1" would not be detected in "1.0 < 1.3")
   -t, --title    [term]      Search JUST the exploit title (Default is title AND the files path)
       --exclude="term"       Remove values from results. By using "|" to separate, you can chain multiple values
                                e.g. --exclude="term1|term2|term3"
       --cve      [CVE]       Search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) value

## Output
   -j, --json     [term]      Show result in JSON format
   -o, --overflow [term]      Exploit titles are allowed to overflow their columns
   -p, --path     [EDB-ID]    Show the full path to an exploit (and also copies the path to the clipboard if possible)
   -v, --verbose              Display more information in output
   -w, --www      [term]      Show URLs to Exploit-DB.com rather than the local path
       --id                   Display the EDB-ID value rather than local path
       --disable-colour       Disable colour highlighting in search results

## Non-Searching
   -m, --mirror   [EDB-ID]    Mirror (aka copies) an exploit to the current working directory
   -x, --examine  [EDB-ID]    Examine (aka opens) the exploit using $PAGER

## Non-Searching
   -h, --help                 Show this help screen
   -u, --update               Check for and install any exploitdb package updates (brew, deb & git)

## Automation
       --nmap     [file.xml]  Checks all results in Nmap XML output with service version
                                e.g.: nmap [host] -sV -oX file.xml

=======
 Notes 
=======
 * You can use any number of search terms
 * By default, search terms are not case-sensitive, ordering is irrelevant, and will search between version ranges
   * Use '-c' if you wish to reduce results by case-sensitive searching
   * And/Or '-e' if you wish to filter results by using an exact match
   * And/Or '-s' if you wish to look for an exact version match
 * Use '-t' to exclude the files path to filter the search results
   * Remove false positives (especially when searching using numbers - i.e. versions)
 * When using '--nmap', adding '-v' (verbose), it will search for even more combinations
 * When updating or displaying help, search terms will be ignored
