Kerberoasting is a technique used to extract and crack service account credentials from the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) in a Windows Active Directory environment. It takes advantage of the way Kerberos pre-authenticates users to obtain encrypted service account tickets, also known as Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets.

#### Features
1. **Kerberos Authentication:** When a user logs into a Windows domain, they are issued a TGT, which is used to request TGS tickets for accessing various network services without entering their credentials repeatedly.
2. **Service Accounts:** Service accounts are used to run background services or applications that need access to network resources. These accounts are often associated with Service Principal Names (SPNs) to authenticate with specific services.
3. **TGS Tickets for Service Accounts:** When a user requests access to a network service, the Domain Controller issues a TGS ticket that includes the service account's encrypted hash.
4. **Kerberoasting:** An attacker can use Kerberoasting to request TGS tickets for service accounts from the Domain Controller. These TGS tickets contain the encrypted hash of the service account's password.
5. **Offline Password Cracking:** Once the attacker has obtained the encrypted hashes, they can extract them from the TGS tickets and perform offline password cracking attempts to determine the plaintext passwords.

To use Kerberoasting, attackers typically leverage tools like "Rubeus" or "Invoke-Kerberoast" in PowerShell, which automate the process of requesting TGS tickets for service accounts and extracting the encrypted hashes.

#### Mitigation
1. **Use Strong Service Account Passwords:**
    - Ensure that service accounts have strong, complex passwords. Weak passwords make it easier for attackers to crack the encrypted hashes obtained through Kerberoasting.
2. **Regularly Rotate Service Account Passwords:**
    - Enforce a password rotation policy for service accounts to limit the exposure of long-term credentials.
3. **Use Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) or Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs):**
    - MSAs and gMSAs have automatically managed passwords and automatically renewing credentials, making them more secure against Kerberoasting attacks.
4. **Limit the Number of Service Accounts:**
    - Minimize the number of service accounts in the environment to reduce the potential attack surface.
5. **Monitor for Unusual Authentication Activity:**
    - Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect abnormal authentication patterns and anomalous service ticket requests.
6. **Disable Pre-Authentication for Sensitive Accounts:**
    - For sensitive accounts, disable pre-authentication, which reduces the exposure of the TGT and makes Kerberoasting more difficult.
7. **Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) Privileged Access:**
    - Use JIT privilege access to grant temporary elevated access only when needed, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to extract TGS tickets.
8. **Enable Credential Guard:**
    - On Windows systems, enable Credential Guard to protect against credential theft, including Kerberoasting attacks.
9. **Use Protected Users Group:**
    - Add critical user accounts to the Protected Users group to enforce strong authentication policies, making it more challenging for attackers to Kerberoast privileged accounts.
10. **Regular Security Training and Awareness:**
	- Educate employees about the risks of social engineering and phishing attacks, which can be used to compromise credentials and facilitate Kerberoasting.
11. **Implement Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD) Carefully:**
	- When using KCD, be cautious about granting unnecessary delegation permissions to service accounts.
12. **Keep Systems and Applications Patched and Updated:**
	- Regularly apply security updates and patches to minimize the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities.
