GPP (Group Policy Preferences) attacks, also known as "cpassword" attacks, refer to a security vulnerability in the way passwords are stored within Group Policy Preferences on Windows systems. This vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by security researchers, and it was widely used by attackers to extract plaintext passwords from GPP settings.

#### Features
1. **Weak Password Encryption:** GPP settings in Active Directory can store passwords with weak encryption. The encrypted password (cpassword) is easily reversible using publicly available tools.
2. **Widespread Use:** GPP settings were commonly used to manage local administrator passwords, wireless network profiles, and other settings in Windows environments.
3. **High-Impact Target:** GPP settings for local administrator passwords are often set at the domain level, meaning the attacker who extracts these passwords gains administrative access to numerous systems.
4. **Non-Interactive Access:** Attackers can perform GPP attacks remotely and non-interactively without requiring direct access to the target system.

#### Usage
1. **Identify GPP Settings:** The attacker first identifies GPP settings within the Active Directory environment that store sensitive information, such as passwords.
2. **Extract cpassword Values:** Using tools like Mimikatz or other GPP attack scripts, the attacker extracts the cpassword values stored in the GPP settings.
3. **Decrypt cpassword:** The attacker then uses publicly available decryption algorithms to reverse the weak encryption used for the cpassword values.
4. **Obtain Plaintext Passwords:** After successfully decrypting the cpassword values, the attacker obtains the plaintext passwords, providing them with unauthorized access to affected systems.

#### Mitigation 
1. **Remove Insecure GPP Settings:** Identify and remove any GPP settings that store passwords or sensitive data in plaintext or weakly encrypted formats.
2. **Use Strong Encryption:** For settings that require passwords, use strong encryption mechanisms to store sensitive data securely.
3. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate any insecure GPP settings in the environment.
4. **Implement LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution):** LAPS is a Microsoft solution that automatically manages the local administrator password on domain-joined computers, providing unique, random, and secure passwords for each system.
5. **Patch and Update Systems:** Keep all systems and applications up to date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
