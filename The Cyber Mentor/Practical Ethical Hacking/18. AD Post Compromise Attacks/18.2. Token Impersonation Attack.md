### Overview
Token impersonation, also known as token-based privilege escalation, is a technique used in Windows environments to elevate privileges from a low-privileged user or process to a higher-privileged one. It involves manipulating the access token associated with a running process to gain additional rights and permissions.

In Windows, when a user logs in or a process is launched, it is associated with an access token. The access token contains information about the user's identity and the security groups they belong to. These groups define the user's privileges and rights on the system. Each process running on the system has its own access token.

1. **Token Impersonation:** Token impersonation is the act of duplicating an access token from a process running with higher privileges and assigning it to a process running with lower privileges. By doing this, the lower-privileged process temporarily gains the same rights and permissions as the higher-privileged process, allowing it to perform actions it would not normally be allowed to do.
    
2. **Token Privilege Escalation:** Token privilege escalation is the act of modifying the access token of a process to add or increase specific privileges, even without impersonating another user. This can grant the process additional capabilities that it wouldn't have had otherwise.

Token impersonation and privilege escalation can be used by attackers as part of their post-exploitation techniques to escalate privileges and gain access to sensitive resources or perform unauthorized actions on a system.

#### Token Types
1. **Token Impersonation:** 
	- Token impersonation is a technique where a process running with higher privileges allows another process to temporarily use its access token. The process with higher privileges is known as the impersonation source, and the process that borrows the token is the impersonation target. The impersonation target can perform actions with the privileges of the impersonation source without actually changing its own identity.
	- Token impersonation is typically used in scenarios where a privileged process needs to perform certain actions on behalf of a lower-privileged user or process. It enables the elevated process to temporarily assume the identity of the lower-privileged user and perform actions that the user would be allowed to do.
2. **Token Delegation:** 
	- Token delegation, on the other hand, involves allowing a service or process to use its access token to perform actions on behalf of a different user or process. Unlike token impersonation, where one process temporarily borrows another's token, token delegation is more permanent and allows a process to act as a representative of another user.
	- Token delegation is often used in distributed applications and scenarios where services need to access network resources on behalf of users or other services. By granting delegation rights, services can securely act as delegates and access resources on the user's behalf, even across network boundaries.

### Incognito
"Incognito" within the "Mimikatz" project that allows token impersonation on Windows systems. Mimikatz is a well-known post-exploitation tool often used for extracting plaintext passwords, manipulating tokens, and performing lateral movement within Windows networks.

#### Features
1. **What is Incognito in Mimikatz:** Incognito is a module in Mimikatz that allows the manipulation and impersonation of access tokens. It provides various capabilities for working with tokens, such as listing available tokens, impersonating a token, adding privileges to a token, and more.
    
2. **Using Incognito in Mimikatz:** To use Incognito, you'll first need to have Mimikatz properly downloaded on the target Windows system. Once Mimikatz is on the system, you can proceed with token impersonation using the following steps:
	- Launch Mimikatz on the target system with administrative privileges.
	- Load the Incognito module within Mimikatz by using the `privilege::debug` command. This command grants the debug privilege, which is necessary for token manipulation.
	- Enumerate available tokens on the system using the `token::elevate` command. This command will display a list of available tokens with their respective security identifiers (SIDs) and usernames.
	- Choose the token you wish to impersonate. Use the `token::impersonate` command, followed by the token's SID, to impersonate the selected token.
	- Once impersonation is successful, you can perform actions with the elevated privileges of the impersonated token.

#### Mitigation
Mitigating against token impersonation and other related privilege escalation techniques is crucial to maintaining the security of Windows systems. Here are some best practices and measures to help mitigate the risk of token impersonation:

1. **Least Privilege:**
	- Implement the principle of least privilege, giving users and processes only the privileges necessary to perform their specific tasks. Limiting unnecessary privileges reduces the potential impact of a token impersonation attack.
2. **Use Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) and Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs):**
	- MSAs and gMSAs are designed for services running on Windows systems. They have automatically managed passwords and automatically renewing credentials, reducing the need for static credentials and tokens.
3. **Use Security-Enhanced Applications (SEAs):**
	- SEAs are applications that are designed to use restricted tokens, which can mitigate token impersonation attacks. They help ensure that applications do not use higher-privileged tokens.
4. **Enable UAC (User Account Control):**
	- UAC prompts users for administrative permissions when needed. It helps prevent the misuse of higher-privileged tokens by requiring user consent before elevating privileges.
5. **Disable Credential Caching:**
	- Prevent users from caching their credentials locally, as this could potentially allow attackers to access cached tokens if they gain access to the system.
6. **Regularly Update Systems and Applications:**
	- Keep all systems and applications up to date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate against known vulnerabilities that attackers may exploit.
7. **Implement Privileged Access Management (PAM):**
	- Use PAM solutions to tightly control and monitor privileged accounts and their access. This can help prevent unauthorized token manipulations.
8. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**
	- Implement robust monitoring and logging solutions to detect and alert on any suspicious token-related activities, such as token impersonation attempts.
9. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
	- Implement MFA for critical accounts and systems. MFA adds an extra layer of protection and can make it harder for attackers to misuse stolen tokens.
10. **Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) Privileges:**
	- Use JIT privilege access to grant temporary elevated access only when needed, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to abuse tokens.

#### Usage
After getting a meterpreter Shell
```bash
meterpreter > load incognito
meterpreter > list_tokens -u
meterpreter > impersonate_token marvel\\administrator
```
This will impersonate admin user on marvel network

```bash
meterpreter > rev2self
meterpreter > hashdump
```
This reverse back to the old user
